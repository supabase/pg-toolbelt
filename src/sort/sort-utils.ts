/**
 * Performs a stable sort of changes according to an ordered list of rules.
 *
 * This implements the **first pass** of the two-pass sorting strategy, providing a
 * coarse-grained global ordering based on change attributes (operation, objectType, scope)
 * without analyzing individual object dependencies.
 *
 * The sort is **stable**, meaning changes that match the same rule (or no rule) maintain
 * their relative order from the input array. This preserves any meaningful ordering from
 * the diff phase.
 *
 * **Why this is needed:**
 * - Establishes a dependency-safe baseline order (e.g., CREATE SCHEMA before CREATE TABLE)
 * - Prevents the majority of dependency conflicts before fine-grained analysis
 * - Fast: O(n log n) with no graph construction or dependency resolution
 * - Predictable: same input always produces same output regardless of dependency graphs
 *
 * After this global sort, a refinement pass handles fine-grained dependencies within
 * specific windows (e.g., ordering ALTER TABLE operations on the same table).
 *
 * @param changes - Array of changes to sort
 * @param rules - Ordered list of rules defining the desired sort order
 * @returns A new array with changes sorted according to the rules
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const sorted = sortChangesByRules(changes, [
 *   { operation: "drop", objectType: "table" },
 *   { operation: "create", objectType: "schema" },
 *   { operation: "create", objectType: "table" },
 * ]);
 * // Result: all DROP TABLE, then CREATE SCHEMA, then CREATE TABLE, then unmatched changes
 * ```
