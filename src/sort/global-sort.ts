/**
 * Global ordering rules for database schema changes, mirroring pg_dump's execution order.
 *
 * This rule set provides a coarse-grained, dependency-safe ordering based purely on
 * operation type (create/alter/drop), object type (table/view/etc), and scope (object/privilege/etc).
 * No graph analysis or fine-grained dependency resolution is performed at this level.
 *
 * Key principles:
 * - DROP operations come first (reverse dependency order: dependents before dependencies)
 * - CREATE/ALTER operations follow (dependency order: dependencies before dependents)
 * - Within each operation, objects are ordered by their typical dependency relationships
 *   (e.g., schemas before tables, tables before indexes)
 * - First-match-wins: a change matches the earliest rule that fits its attributes
 * - Changes not matching any rule maintain their relative input order
 *
 * This ordering resolves the vast majority of dependency issues without needing to analyze
 * individual object dependencies, making it fast and predictable. Fine-grained conflicts
 * (e.g., between ALTER TABLE operations) are resolved in a second refinement pass.
 *
 * Derived from PostgreSQL's pg_dump ordering and real-world migration execution patterns.
