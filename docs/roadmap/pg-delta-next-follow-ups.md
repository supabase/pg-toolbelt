# pg-delta-next — known pitfalls & follow-ups

Captured from the code review of PR #315 (orderless declarative apply, grouped
export, formatting, redaction). These are **known, accepted** at merge time —
recorded here so they aren't rediscovered. Nothing below blocks the stacked
`feat/pg-delta-next` line from landing, but each should be picked up before the
engine is promoted past preview.

Severity legend: **P1** correctness/safety, **P2** contract/coverage gap,
**P3** cleanup/maintainability.

> **Cutover triage (2026-08):** see the "Old-engine differential review" section

## P1 — correctness & safety

### Co-located shadow can execute cluster-global DDL against the live cluster — ✅ core hole fixed in this PR

`packages/pg-delta-next/src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts` applies each file inside
`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, which already blocks every cluster-global non-transactional
statement (`ALTER SYSTEM`, `CREATE/DROP DATABASE`, `CREATE/DROP TABLESPACE`,
`VACUUM`, …) with `SQLSTATE 25001`. The actual escape was the 25001 **raw
fallback**: `applyFile` re-ran the offending single statement via
`client.query(sql)` *outside* the transaction, so on a co-located shadow (which
shares the target's live cluster) those statements executed against the customer's
cluster and persisted after the shadow was dropped.

**Fixed:** the raw fallback is now gated by `RAW_FALLBACK_ALLOWLIST` — one entry,
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, the only non-transactional statement a declarative
schema legitimately contains. Every other 25001-raiser is refused with a
`ShadowLoadError` (`unsupported_non_transactional`) instead of running
unsandboxed; this also closes `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION (connect = true)` opening a
live replication connection from the shadow. Deterministic loader refusals now
rethrow immediately rather than being retried until the round budget exhausts.
Regression coverage in `tests/load-sql-files-atomicity.test.ts` (a `VACUUM` file
is refused; a `CREATE DATABASE` file is refused and never creates the sibling
database; `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` still loads).

**Deliberately not done (low likelihood — see review discussion):** the engine
never emits these statements and Supabase declarative schemas realistically never
contain them (on managed Supabase the applier isn't even superuser, so they fail
permission-denied rather than leak). So the two heavier layers from the design
were skipped:

- Extending `CLUSTER_DDL_RULES` / flipping it to an allowlist for an *up-front*
  refusal (before the shadow is provisioned) and to also catch the *transactional*
  cluster-global forms (`ALTER DATABASE … SET`, `GRANT … ON DATABASE`).
- Post-load `pg_database` / `pg_tablespace` snapshot checks (mirroring the
  existing role-leak snapshot) to catch dynamic-SQL-smuggled transactional forms.

The genuinely airtight fix remains the isolated ephemeral cluster in
[ephemeral-shadow-design.md](ephemeral-shadow-design.md); the fallback allowlist
is correct and useful regardless of whether that lands.

### pg-topo total-order change flips pg-delta declarative-apply on cycles — ✅ resolved in this PR

`packages/pg-topo/src/analyze-and-sort.ts` now returns `ordered` as a **total
order** that appends dependency-cycle members, where it previously returned only
the acyclic-drainable prefix (cycle members surfaced separately via
`cycleGroups`). `@supabase/pg-topo` is a published package and
`packages/pg-delta/src/core/declarative-apply` consumes `ordered` directly: on a
genuine cycle its status now flips from silent-success-with-fewer-statements to
`stuck` — the correct outcome, since an unbreakable cycle cannot be applied and
should fail loudly rather than silently drop statements.

**Resolved:**

- Semver: the changeset (`.changeset/pg-topo-total-ordered.md`) is bumped from
  patch to **minor** and its wording now spells out the consumer-observable
  behavior change (declarative apply reports `stuck` on a true cycle instead of
  a partial success).
- Coverage: `packages/pg-delta/tests/integration/declarative-apply.test.ts` now
  has a cycle case (mutual-FK tables) asserting every input statement reaches
  the applier (`totalStatements === 3`), a `CYCLE_DETECTED` diagnostic, and a
  `stuck` result. Verified RED against the pre-total-order behavior
  (`totalStatements` was `1` — the two cyclic tables were dropped from
  `ordered`).

### Formatter strands the action keyword on every `ALTER TABLE` under `--format` — ✅ resolved in this PR

In `packages/pg-delta-next/src/frontends/sql-format/`, `scanTokens` drops
double-quoted identifiers, so `formatAlterTable`'s positional cursor landed on
the action keyword and `skipQualifiedName` (`tokenizer.ts`) consumed it. Because
the renderer's `qid()` **always** double-quotes, every engine-rendered
`ALTER TABLE "s"."t" <ACTION> …` hit this when formatting was enabled:

```
ALTER TABLE "public"."users" ADD
    COLUMN a int
```

This affected **all** `ALTER TABLE` forms (`ADD COLUMN`, `ENABLE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY`, `REPLICA IDENTITY`, …) and the sibling `formatAlterGeneric`
(`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW`/`DOMAIN`/`FOREIGN TABLE`/…).

**Fixed:** both `formatAlterTable` and `formatAlterGeneric` now find the name's
true end from the raw statement via `qualifiedNameEnd` (the helper the
CREATE-family formatters already use), instead of positional token indexing.
Regression coverage lives in `format-quoted-names.test.ts`.

**Remaining follow-up (same root cause, different symptom):**
`keyword-case.ts` (`isCaseableInContext` / the ALTER handler around line 846)
still uses `skipQualifiedName` to find the action-token region, so for a
quoted-name `ALTER TABLE` the per-action keyword-casing loop starts one token
late and can skip casing the first action keyword. Lower severity (casing, not
stranding) — fix it the same way (anchor on `qualifiedNameEnd`) when the
keyword-case pass is next touched.

## P2 — contract & coverage gaps

### pg-delta CI does not re-run on pg-topo changes — ✅ resolved in this PR

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` gated the pg-delta unit/integration/check-types
jobs on `packages/pg-delta/**` (or root) only. A pg-topo-only change — like this
PR's `ordered` contract change — never re-ran pg-delta's suites, even though
pg-delta imports `@supabase/pg-topo` at runtime. (The merge queue forces all
outputs true, so the gap was real at PR-review time but masked at merge time.)

**Fixed:** the `pg-delta` check-types step, `pg-delta-unit`,
`pg-delta-test-image-hash`, and `pg-delta-integration` jobs now also fire on
`needs.detect-changes.outputs.pg-topo == 'true'`. The `detect-changes` action
already emitted a `pg-topo` output, so no filter change was needed. `knip
(pg-delta)` was intentionally left on the pg-delta-only gate — it inspects
pg-delta's own unused code, which a pg-topo change cannot affect.

### Changesets version a private package — ✅ resolved in this PR

55 changesets target `@supabase/pg-delta`, which is `"private": true` /
`0.0.0`. The repo is in changeset pre-release (alpha) mode and
`.changeset/pre.json`'s `initialVersions` doesn't list pg-delta-next, so
`changeset status` planned a **minor** bump for it — the release workflow would
have consumed all 55 into a `chore: release` PR that bumps the unpublishable
package and writes a large CHANGELOG (`changeset publish` skips private packages,
so this was churn, not breakage).

**Fixed:** added `@supabase/pg-delta` to `.changeset/config.json` `ignore`.
This is safe and non-destructive — all 55 changesets are standalone (they
reference no other package) and no published package depends on pg-delta-next, so
`ignore` neither errors nor cascades. The changesets are preserved (ignored
changesets aren't consumed) and `changeset status` now plans only
`@supabase/pg-topo` (patch). When pg-delta-next is eventually published, remove
it from `ignore` to release the accumulated history.

### `elideCascadeSubsumedPolicyDrops` ignores policy→role references

`packages/pg-delta-next/src/plan/internal.ts` judges whether a dropped object is
load-bearing from `pg_depend` edges only. A policy's referenced roles live in
`pg_shdepend` and are carried on the fact payload (`roles`), not as graph edges,
so a role-referencing policy's `DROP POLICY` can be elided as cascade-subsumed.
The `DROP OWNED BY <role>; DROP ROLE <role>` sequence in `rules/roles.ts` covers
the general case, but the sole-role-in-policy ordering is untested
(`policy-drop-compaction.test.ts` covers only the view case). **Follow-up:** add
the role scenario to the corpus.

### `elideCoCreateRevokeBeforeGrant` guard reads only desired facts

The `defaultGrantsOutside` guard in `internal.ts` inspects only **desired**
`defaultPrivilege` facts, so a *source-only* `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` being
dropped in the same plan can still fire at create time — leaving the applied ACL
a superset of desired. The proof loop diffs ACLs post-apply, so any
corpus-covered scenario is safe; an uncovered one ships undetected.
**Follow-up:** add a corpus scenario that drops a source-only ADP alongside a
co-created grant.

### pgmq tables excluded by a name-glob bandaid

`packages/pg-delta-next/src/policy/supabase.ts` re-includes user triggers in
managed schemas, then carves pgmq's `q_*`/`a_*` queue/archive tables back out by
name glob (scoped to the `pgmq` schema). The comment concedes this compensates
for pgmq creating its tables via `pgmq.create()` rather than `CREATE EXTENSION`,
so extract-time `pg_depend` `'e'` membership misses them. If pgmq changes its
internal naming — or a user creates a `q_*` table inside the pgmq schema — the
classification is wrong. **Deeper fix:** tag pgmq-created objects as
extension/owner-owned at extraction time so the generic ownership exclusion
covers them.

### `$1$…$1$` digit dollar-tags mis-scanned

`sql-scanner.ts`'s `readDollarTag` (and the regex in `load-sql-files.ts`) accept
digit-leading dollar tags, so `$1$…$1$` is treated as a dollar-quoted span even
though Postgres parses `$1` as a positional parameter. Unlikely in
engine-rendered SQL; low severity but a real divergence from Postgres
tokenization.

## P3 — cleanup (batch into a follow-up chore PR)

- **Three hand-rolled SQL scanners, two disagreeing.** `walkSql`
  (`sql-scanner.ts`) and `protectDollarQuotes` (`protect.ts`) don't nest-count
  block comments; `maskLiteralsAndComments` (`load-sql-files.ts`) does. Unify on
  one scanner (this also closes the `$1$` item above).
- **`quoteIdent` re-implemented ~6×** (`plan/render.ts`, `core/stable-id.ts`,
  `cli/shadow.ts`, `load-sql-files.ts` ×2, `proof/prove.ts`). Extract one
  helper; runtime/CLI callers can use `escapeIdentifier` from `pg`.
- **`formatMixedItems` is a byte-for-byte duplicate** of `formatKeyValueItems`
  (`format-utils.ts`). Delete it; point its call sites at the original.
- **Dead branches** in `keyword-case.ts` `isCaseableInContext` (`OR`, and
  `AS`+`CREATE`) return the same value as the fall-through default.
- **`cmdSchemaApply` is a ~600-line God-function** (`cli/commands/schema.ts`):
  duplicated role-name derivation, 5× copy-pasted enum-flag validation. Split
  into `parseApplyFlags` / `resolveScopeAndProfile` / `prepareFiles` /
  `resolveShadow` / `runApply`, add a `parseEnumFlag` helper.
- **Perf nits:** `internal.ts` teardown scans the full edge list per destroyed
  id (use the existing `incomingEdgesByEncoded` reverse index, cf.
  `replacement-expansion.ts`); `diff.ts` and `snapshot.ts` sort comparators
  rebuild keys per comparison (Schwartzian transform); `keyword-case.ts` makes
  two full passes (scanTokens + walkSql); `load-sql-files` does 3 round-trips per
  file; `schema.ts` calls `mkdirSync` per exported file.
- **Test/script infra duplicated from pg-delta:** `tests/containers.ts` and
  `scripts/sync-supabase-base-images.ts` re-derive helpers that already exist in
  pg-delta's test/script harness (`ensureSupabaseDbMajorVersion` is already
  exported). `collectSqlFiles` duplicates pg-topo's `discoverSqlFiles`. `hash.ts`
  vs pg-delta `fingerprint.ts` is likely a deliberate independent equality
  surface — add a comment saying so, so nobody "fixes" it by importing.
- **`protect.ts` body-protection kind list** is hand-maintained and disconnected
  from the per-kind rule metadata the renderer uses; drive it from the same
  metadata so the formatter and plan agree on which kinds carry an opaque body.
- **`formatters.ts` repetition:** ~18 hand-written command-prefix guards and a
  copy-pasted parenthesized-list assembly → `matchesPrefix` + `formatParenBlock`
  helpers.

## Documented, by-design (no action — recorded so they aren't re-flagged)

- **`rootHash` folds reference-only facts** (`core/fact.ts`). Intentional: the
  apply fingerprint gate relies on it, so a plan is only applicable against the
  same baseline. Consequence: the same database fingerprinted under different
  profiles yields different `rootHash`es, and `view.facts()` includes
  reference-only platform/extension facts. Consumers that care must filter
  `referenceOnly`; the load-bearing ones already do.
- **pg-topo README** states `ordered` "always contains every input statement
  exactly once." Accurate for *statements*, but a file that fails parsing
  contributes zero statement nodes and is therefore absent. pg-delta's
  declarative-apply has no `PARSE_ERROR` fallback, so a parse failure yields a
  silently-incomplete apply reported as success. Doc-wording + consumer-hardening
  follow-up.
- **Deleted dogfood differential harness** (`differential.test.ts`,
  `old-engine.ts`). Not a coverage loss: the new proof loop applies each scenario
  against real Postgres and diffs the resulting facts against ground truth — a
  stronger check than comparing two engines. Only the cross-engine
  *diagnostic-quality* comparison is gone.

## PR #315 review triage (Codex)

**Fixed in this PR (P1):**

- `export-manifest.ts` — fail closed on a malformed manifest.
- `view.ts` — preserve reference-only marks across fact projection.
- `schema.ts` — re-check executable SQL after `--skip-cluster-ddl` stripping.
- `load-sql-files.ts` non-role cluster DDL — already closed by the 25001
  fallback allowlist (see the shadow item above).
- `.changeset/pg-topo-total-ordered.md` — already bumped to minor.

**False positive:** `dbdev-roundtrip.test.ts` "missing dbdev fixture helper" —
`scripts/lib/bootstrap-dbdev-fixture.ts` is committed and tracked.

**Deferred P1 — owner-based policy exclusion is blind under `--scope database`
— ✅ resolved (Unit H; see "Supabase roundtrip hardening" below — the managed
view is now `projectManagementScope(resolveView(raw, …), scope)` in one place):**

`cmdSchemaApply` projects both fact bases to management scope (`schema.ts:936-937`)
*before* `plan()` applies the policy. `projectManagementScope("database")` prunes
`role`/`membership` facts and every `owner` edge (they point at roles); the policy
owner predicate (`policy.ts:~397`) resolves owner from that edge (the extractor
never populates `payload.owner`), so the Supabase `{ owner: SUPABASE_SYSTEM_ROLES }`
exclusion (`supabase.ts:322`) can't match — a platform-role-owned object in a USER
schema (e.g. a `supabase_admin`-owned table in `public`) is treated as managed and
planned for DROP/ALTER. Data loss, in the default scope. (`schema export` already
composes the correct order — `resolveView` then project — so an export omits these
objects while a subsequent apply drops them.)

Deferred to its own PR because it changes core plan/apply/prove signatures and has
deliberate test-harness fallout. Recommended fix (Fable design):

- Add a trailing `scope: ManagementScope = "cluster"` param to `resolveView`
  (`policy.ts`) that applies `projectManagementScope` as the LAST step — owner
  edges are intact when the owner rule is evaluated, and
  `excludeFactsAndDescendants` already carries `referenceOnly` forward.
- Thread `scope` through `PlanOptions.scope` → `Plan.scope` (stamped like
  `capability`) → both `resolveView` calls in `change-set.ts` → the `apply`
  fingerprint gate (`apply.ts:145`) → both `resolveView` calls in `prove.ts:436`.
- In `schema.ts`, delete the two `projectManagementScope` calls (936-937) and the
  one in the fingerprint-gate re-extract closure (1000-1004); pass `scope` in
  `planOptions` instead. Export path unchanged.
- `"cluster"` (default) makes `projectManagementScope` identity, so the DB-to-DB
  plan path and the corpus are byte-identical (verify with a full corpus run).
- **Test-harness landmine:** `supabaseCluster()` connects as `supabase_admin` (a
  system role), so `phase2b-seed-shadow.test.ts` shadow objects become owner-
  excluded and strand requirements. Fix those tests to apply as a non-system
  login role (as `supabase-dsl-e2e.test.ts` already does) — do NOT weaken the fix.
- RED: a supabase-profile integration test where a `supabase_admin`-owned table in
  `public` must survive `schema apply --scope database --profile supabase` (today
  it is planned for DROP). Plus `resolve-view.test.ts` unit cases for the new param.

**Deferred P2 (tracked follow-ups; not blocking this PR):**

- ✅ **resolved** — `extract/routines.ts` window functions: `prokind 'w'` is now
  in the extraction query and the dependency resolver
  (`src/extract/routines.ts:37`, `src/extract/dependencies.ts:104`). Was: the
  resolver used `('f','p','a')` only.
- `frontends/seed-assumed-schemas.ts` — quick-mode supabase seeding filters out
  platform extension members (e.g. `pg_graphql`), so a user object referencing
  one fails to load in the co-located shadow. Seed the owning platform extension
  or keep those members.
- `frontends/sql-order.ts` `orderForShadow` — drops parse diagnostics, so a
  library caller can silently pass a partial desired state (same root as the
  pg-topo PARSE_ERROR item above). Return the analysis or throw on blocking
  diagnostics.
- `cli/commands/schema.ts` — co-located shadow lifecycle: `process.exit` skips
  the `finally` that drops `pgdelta_shadow_*` (Bun); `--isolated-shadow` on the
  co-located path skips the role-leak snapshot; dynamic (DO-block) cluster DDL
  isn't contained. (Related to the deferred shadow-hardening layers above.)
- Redaction/legacy-snapshot handling: `apply.ts`, `drift.ts`, `schema.ts` —
  treat legacy (unstamped) snapshots/exports as unredacted; `routines.ts` reject
  snapshots missing routine metadata.
- `plan/rules/helpers.ts` / `frontends/export-sql-files.ts` — preserve built-in
  defaults when dropping ADPs; avoid seeding non-ambient reference-only facts.
- Test hygiene: `redaction-output.test.ts` and `policy.test.ts` create databases
  / roles on the shared cluster without dropping them (leak); the
  `privilege-operations--create-grant-drop-unrelated` corpus case needs
  `isolatedCluster: true` so the CREATE ROLE + GRANT ordering is actually tested.
- `plan/internal.ts` `elideCascadeSubsumedPolicyDrops` — a policy's `TO <role>`
  refs live in the payload, not as edges, so dropping a table+role can elide the
  only `DROP POLICY` that releases the role (also on our own review list).
- ✅ **resolved** — `frontends/load-sql-files.ts` `CLUSTER_DDL_RULES` user
  mappings: the role regexes now carry a `user(?!\s+mapping)` negative lookahead
  (`load-sql-files.ts:373-395`), so `CREATE/ALTER/DROP USER MAPPING` is no
  longer refused/stripped under database scope.
- `frontends/load-sql-files.ts` `maskLiteralsAndComments` — treats only doubled
  quotes as escapes, not `E'...\''` backslash escapes, so an `E`-string with a
  `;` can mis-split and trip the cluster-DDL / statement scanners. Make the mask
  E-string-aware (or reuse the sql-format scanner).
- `cli/commands/schema.ts` — a dir with `SET ROLE` / `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`
  / `SET search_path` leaves session state on the pooled client after the load
  (survives COMMIT), so validation/extraction can run under the wrong role. Reset
  session state after loading or isolate it.
- `plan/phases/action-emitter.ts` — default-ACL hygiene on replaced objects keys
  off the FINAL owner, but under `--restrict-to-applier` the recreate runs as the
  applier, so an applier-level ADP grant can survive without a matching REVOKE.
  Key the hygiene off the creator/applier role for recreated objects.
- Redaction safety: `extract/sensitive-options.ts` redacts `file_fdw`'s standard
  `filename` (not in the allowlist), producing a placeholder path that applies to
  a bogus file; `extract/publications.ts` keeps `enabled: true` for a redacted
  subscription, so a default redacted export can activate a worker against a
  placeholder conninfo. Both should preserve the non-credential value or refuse.

## PR #299 review triage (Codex) — engine-hardening backlog

Context: PR #299 promoted the clean-room engine to `@supabase/pg-delta` (the hard
switch). Codex re-reviews every commit and re-surfaces **pre-existing** engine gaps
— the switch itself only moved the package and added the build/CI/docs, so the
engine code is byte-identical to pre-switch. **None of these are switch
regressions**, and none were fixed in #299 (scope kept to the switch). They belong
to the engine-hardening track, alongside the extract-completeness fixes already
landed here (reloptions, aggregate/range/identity/subscription options: `f530082`,
`1fbdc69`, `528bc60`, `ed1bcdd`, `a638ecf`). Recorded with `comment_id`s for pickup.

### Batch A — planning/extract crashes on legitimate declarative input (highest value)

These make `plan` / `schema apply` / `export` throw on inputs a user can legitimately
author. The first two share the "nullable/`false` transition → `str()` throws → route
to **replace**" pattern already used for policy clause removal (`d2cdbf7`).

- **constraint validated→NOT VALID** — ✅ **resolved** (`e1f46694`): routed to
  replace (`src/plan/rules/constraints.ts:63-82`); corpus
  `domain-operations--not-valid-constraint`. Was: `validated` delta with
  `to === false` called `str(to)` and aborted (comment `3537607442`).
- **foreign server VERSION removal** — ✅ **resolved**:
  `replaceWhen: (_from, to) => to == null` (`src/plan/rules/foreign.ts:73`);
  corpus `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--remove-server-version`. Was:
  `version` → `null` threw in the alter path (comment `3537607455`).
- **enum rebuild with enum-array column** — ✅ **resolved** (`c410cd19`): the
  rewrite reads each dependent column fact's desired type and renders the array
  cast (`src/plan/rules/types.ts:389-398`); corpus
  `type-ops--enum-replace-array-column`. Was: scalar `TYPE <enum>` rendered
  unconditionally (comment `3537607496`).
- **reference-only export member under a managed non-public schema** — ✅ **resolved**
  `src/frontends/export-sql-files.ts` (comment `3537607461`). Member seeded into
  the pristine baseline without its schema parent → `buildFactBase` missing-parent
  throw before any file renders. **Fix:** exclude extension members from the export
  baseline (via `extensionMemberReferenceOnly`) — they never need seeding
  (`CREATE EXTENSION` materializes them; the requirement guard's
  `memberExtensionPresent` satisfies any consumer), and the managed install schema
  is still exported so the result reloads. Regression:
  `tests/export-extension-member-parent.test.ts`.
- **user mapping on a filtered extension-owned server** — ✅ **resolved**
  (`3aa068c0`): mappings share the server's `notExtensionMember` anti-join
  (`src/extract/foreign.ts`); regression
  `tests/foreign-extension-user-mapping.test.ts`. Was: orphan mappings parented
  to an absent server fact → missing-parent throw (comment `3537607477`).

### Batch B — rendering / access / library correctness

- **zero-argument aggregate metadata** — ✅ **resolved** (`9c9c81d9`): renders
  `(*)` for empty args (`src/plan/render.ts:68-70`); corpus
  `aggregate-operations--comment-zero-arg`. Was: `()` rendered, failing the
  metadata statement (comment `3537607470`).
- **role security labels touch `pg_authid`** — ✅ **resolved** (`56729c76`):
  joins through `pg_roles` (`src/extract/security-labels.ts:230`); regression
  `tests/nonsuperuser-extraction-gaps.test.ts`. Was: superuser-only `pg_authid`
  read failed non-superuser extraction (comment `3537607465`).
- **default apply gate ignores plan redaction mode** — ✅ **resolved**
  (`56729c76`): the default re-extract passes
  `redactSecrets: thePlan.redactSecrets ?? true` (`src/apply/apply.ts:235`).
  Was: an unredacted plan re-extracted redacted, so the fingerprint gate
  rejected an unchanged target (comment `3537607487`; display-vs-apply
  redaction follow-up `3428269873` still open).

`prokind='w'` (`3536715714`)~~ ✅ resolved (`routines.ts:37`,
`dependencies.ts:104`), publication-member rebuild on table replace (`3536715717`).

### Wave 2 (re-review of commit `ada0ab5`) — more of the same track

Planning / export / apply fidelity:

- **typed-table `OF` relationships** — `src/plan/rules/tables.ts:64` (comment
  `3537805071`). A `CREATE TABLE ... OF composite_type` renders as an ordinary
  `CREATE TABLE (...)`; the only catalog difference is a depends-edge (which emits no
  DDL), so typedness-only changes no-op and from-empty plans recreate typed tables as
  ordinary ones. Needs a `pg_class.reloftype` marker on the payload to drive replace.
- **by-object export FK atomicity** — `src/frontends/export-sql-files.ts:388` (comment
  `3537805092`). By-object export appends every table action to one file, but
  `loadSqlFiles` applies each file atomically; for mutually-dependent FKs the plan is
  correctly ordered but regrouped so each file's FK references the other's not-yet-
  committed table → both roll back. Keep FK alters in dependency-order runs / separate
  files to preserve the by-object fidelity contract.
- **policy `TO`-role release before DROP ROLE** — ✅ **resolved**: the alter
  releases every role in `fromRoles` not present in `toRoles`
  (`src/plan/rules/policies.ts:63-65`). Was: `ALTER POLICY … TO …` neither
  released nor consumed the old role (comment `3537805111`). The sibling
  `elideCascadeSubsumedPolicyDrops` payload-roles gap is still open.

Extract-completeness / coverage (invisible drift):

- **ICU collation rules** — `src/extract/types.ts:298` (comment `3537805075`).
  `pg_collation.collicurules` isn't hashed, so a `RULES`-only difference compares equal
  and from-empty emits `CREATE COLLATION` without the rules.
- **user-defined conversions unmodeled** — `src/extract/unmodeled.ts:62` (comment
  `3537805081`). The completeness probe omits `pg_conversion`, so a `CREATE CONVERSION`
  yields neither a fact nor an `unmodeled_kind` diagnostic — strict coverage silently
  ignores it.
- **extension-member columns dropped from the reference view** —
  `src/extract/relations.ts:138` (comment `3537805086`). The anti-join skips column
  facts of an ext-owned table even when the table is kept as a member, so column
  satellites (comment/seclabel) and column-level edges dangle. Keep columns as
  reference-only descendants.
- **column-level privileges** — `src/extract/relations.ts:129` (comment `3537805098`).
  `pg_attribute.attacl` (`GRANT SELECT (col)`) isn't emitted as an `acl` satellite, so
  column-grant-only diffs are invisible and from-empty exports drop them.
- **role comments in cluster scope** — `src/extract/roles.ts:32` (comment `3537805102`).
  Cluster-scope role facts never emit a comment satellite, so `COMMENT ON ROLE` drift is
  invisible and from-empty cluster exports omit it (the renderer already supports it).

### Wave 3 (re-reviews of `671a799` / `5e26a52`) — more extract-completeness / replace-cascade

Only the findings NOT already listed above (Codex re-issues the earlier ones — role
membership options, db-scoped GUCs, unlogged sequences, matview populated, range
CANONICAL, foreign-column `attfdwoptions` — with fresh comment_ids each pass).

Replace / apply cascade:

- **FDW server children rebuild on replace** — ✅ **resolved** by `da2d75c1`.
  Replacement emission recursively drops children across non-cascading server
  boundaries, recreates surviving descendants after the server, and is pinned in
  both directions by `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--replace-server-with-children`.
  The original finding was comment `3537910549`.

Extract-completeness (invisible drift / wrong from-empty replay):

- **composite attribute order** — `src/extract/types.ts` (comment `3537910546`). ✅ **partially
  resolved** (Unit A, this branch): `attnum` is now carried as non-semantic `_position` and the
  from-empty composite `CREATE TYPE` renders in declared order, so reconstruction no longer
  changes row layout. STILL OPEN: the order-only-diff-*detection* half — a field-order-only
  difference still compares equal (position is `_`-excluded from the hash by design), so a live
  reorder is not detected as a delta. Making position semantic needs type-rebuild machinery for
  order-only changes and would invalidate every snapshot/baseline — deferred.
- **comments on constraint-backed indexes** — `src/extract/relations.ts:272` (comment
  `3537910554`). The index anti-join drops the index fact for a PK/unique/exclusion
  constraint, and the constraint extractor reads only `pg_constraint` comments, so a
  `COMMENT ON INDEX` on that index is lost.
- **table tablespaces** — `src/extract/relations.ts:82` (comment `3537910560`).
  `pg_class.reltablespace` isn't hashed and no create/alter renders `TABLESPACE`;
  tablespace-only diffs no-op and from-empty replay uses the default tablespace.
- **table access methods** — `src/extract/relations.ts:36` (comment `3537910571`).
  `pg_class.relam` (`CREATE TABLE … USING …`) isn't recorded; AM-only diffs compare
  equal and from-empty replay uses the default table AM.
- **column storage metadata** — `src/extract/relations.ts:100` (comment `3537910575`).
  `SET STORAGE` / `SET COMPRESSION` / `SET STATISTICS` (on `pg_attribute`) aren't
  extracted or rendered; those-only diffs are invisible and from-empty replay uses
  defaults.
- **role `VALID UNTIL`** — `src/extract/roles.ts:30` (comment `3537910580`). The
  password-expiry attribute isn't on the role payload; a login role differing only by
  expiry compares equal and from-empty cluster export drops it.
- **subscription `failover`** — `src/extract/publications.ts:135` (comment `3537910587`).
  The version-gated subscription option list stops at `run_as_owner`/`origin`; a
  `failover`-only difference hashes identically and from-empty replay omits it.
- **subscription `password_required`** — `src/extract/publications.ts` (PR #388
  Codex re-review; the only NEW fragment in that batch). `subpasswordrequired`
  (PG16+) isn't extracted, so `password_required = false` compares equal to the
  default and a recreate re-enables it. Superuser-only DDL that interacts with
  the `subconninfo` secret-redaction path — handle with the `failover` entry
  above. Tracked in Linear CLI-2134.

### Wave 4 (re-review of `bd68f7b`) — apply-ordering / access / shadow

New findings only (multiple-inheritance parents `3538433909` and window-function deps
`3538433920` are re-issues of `3536715681` / `3536715714` above).

Apply ordering / cascade (plan can fail at apply):

- **release old sequence owner before dropping it** — ✅ **resolved**:
  `sequenceOwnedBySpecs` takes `releaseOld` and populates `releases`
  (`src/plan/rules/sequences.ts:104`, `helpers.ts:476-512`). Was: the alter
  consumed only the new owner, so the old table could drop first (comment
  `3538433876`).
- **order in-place alters after new dependencies** — ✅ **resolved**: column
  type alters consume the new target via `dependencyConsumes(view, fact.id)`
  (`src/plan/rules/tables.ts:256`). Was: the desired dependency edge was never
  walked, so the ALTER could sort before the CREATE (comment `3538433892`).
- **move extensions before dropping their old schema** — ✅ **resolved**: the
  move declares `releases: [{ kind: "schema", name: str(from) }]`
  (`src/plan/rules/schemas.ts:107`), ordering it before `DROP SCHEMA old`. Was:
  only `new` was consumed (comment `3538433899`).

Access / shadow correctness:

- **subscription conninfo read as non-superuser** — ✅ **resolved**
  (`56729c76`): the query includes `subconninfo` only after a
  `has_column_privilege` probe (`src/extract/publications.ts:145-152`);
  regression `tests/nonsuperuser-extraction-gaps.test.ts`. Was: the
  unconditional select aborted non-superuser diffs (comment `3538433886`).
- **shadow emptiness check misses non-relation objects** —
  `src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts:459` (comment `3538433916`). The guard checks only
  `pg_class`, so a shadow pre-loaded with enums/domains/routines/collations/extensions/
  default-privileges is treated as empty; the load then extracts that pre-existing state
  as if it were declared, contaminating the desired fact base. Cover all managed catalogs.

## Supabase roundtrip hardening (non-superuser Cloud fidelity) — this branch

Driven by the Supabase roundtrip acceptance harness (`scripts/roundtrip-supabase.ts`)
applying as the production-faithful role a real Cloud project hands users: a NON-superuser
`postgres` that is a member of `supabase_privileged_role` (not the `supabase_admin` the test
harness previously stood in with — see `tests/containers.ts`). The old SUPERUSER shim masked
a series of real non-superuser failures, each fixed RED-first on this branch:

- **composite attribute order** — Unit A (see above; ✅ render/export, detection deferred).
- **body validation blocked user applies on platform code** — ✅ Unit B: routine-body
  validation failures in seeded (assumed-schema) schemas are now named warnings, not hard
  errors; user-schema failures still block and now name the routine; the CLI prints the
  per-routine `ShadowLoadError.details`.
- **body validation of non-sql/plpgsql routines** — ✅ Unit G
  (`src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts`): the pass is scoped to `lanname IN ('sql','plpgsql')`
  (the only bodies `check_function_bodies` validates). `LANGUAGE internal` range-support
  functions auto-generated by `CREATE TYPE … AS RANGE` are non-superuser-uncreatable and
  have no checkable body.
- **co-located seed not replayable by non-superuser** — ✅ Unit C
  (`src/frontends/seed-assumed-schemas.ts`): the seed omits `defaultPrivilege` facts and
  skips routines whose `pg_proc.proconfig` sets a superuser-only GUC (carried structurally
  as non-semantic `_configGucs`; NO SQL-text editing — see the doctrine in
  `.github/agents/pg-toolbelt.md`) plus their in-seed dependents.
- **system-role ADP exported as user state** — ✅ Unit E (`src/policy/supabase.ts` Rule 6b):
  `defaultPrivilege` facts whose FOR-role (`id.role`) is a system role are excluded
  (platform-managed); grantee-side ADP (the user-owned API-role default) is kept.
- **inline constraints folded over deferred columns** — ✅ Unit D
  (`src/plan/internal.ts` `compactColumnFolds`): a table constraint is no longer folded
  inline when a same-table column it references was deferred to a later `ADD COLUMN`
  (domain-typed / generated columns) — it renders as a standalone `ADD CONSTRAINT`.
- **owner-based policy exclusion defeated under database scope** — ✅ Unit H
  (`src/plan/phases/change-set.ts` + `plan.ts`/`apply.ts`/`prove.ts`): the managed view is
  now `projectManagementScope(resolveView(raw, …), scope)` in one place, so owner edges
  survive policy resolution and a policy owner-exclusion rule (Supabase Rule 6) correctly
  excludes system-role-owned platform objects (event triggers, etc.) instead of planning a
  DROP the applier cannot execute. This had been silently DROPping platform event triggers
  under the SUPERUSER shim.

### Still open

- **P2 — local-`supabase start` vs Cloud baseline drift.** After all fixes, the roundtrip's
  ONLY residual diff is `schemas/public/default_privileges.sql`: the local base-init fixture
  (`tests/fixtures/supabase-base-init/*.sql`, from `supabase start`) carries
  `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE "postgres" … REVOKE ALL … FROM "postgres"` entries the
  Cloud source project does not. No loader/policy/engine change fixes this — it is a
  baseline-DATA divergence between local and Cloud provisioning. This is the concrete case
  for the versioned-baseline-sidecar work (per-stack-fingerprint baselines derived from real
  Cloud state rather than a local-fixture capture). See
  [ephemeral-shadow-design.md § "Adjacent proposal"](ephemeral-shadow-design.md#adjacent-proposal-docker-urls-and-a-supabase-shadow-image)
  for why generating that baseline from a `docker://supabase/<major>` image (+ per-service
  setup scripts) was rejected, and the recommended derive-from-the-target sequencing.
- **P3 — bootstrapped explicit `--shadow` for the supabase profile.** A user-bootstrapped
  (base-init'd) explicit `--shadow` currently trips the loader emptiness guard ("shadow
  database is not empty"). Deferred deliberately: a bootstrapped shadow's platform surface
  matches the installer era, not the target, so managed-scope divergences would surface as
  phantom migrations — strictly more dangerous than the target-derived co-located seed, and
  its one advantage (no reconstruction) is moot now that the seed is non-superuser-replayable
  (Unit C). Revisit only alongside the baseline-sidecar work, which would make
  bootstrap-vs-target drift detectable.

## Old-engine differential review (2026-08) — cutover triage

A differential review of the clean-room engine against the last legacy release,
triaged for the cutover decision (promoting `@supabase/pg-delta` past
preview/alpha). This section is the durable record — if a finding below is
re-raised in a later review, reply with a link here.

| # | Finding | State | vs. previous engine | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1a | `DROP DEFAULT` emitted on identity/generated column type change | reproduced | **regression** — old engine guarded it | **blocker** → ✅ [#379](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/379) |
| P1b | `SET MAXVALUE` ordered before `TYPE` widening on identity columns | reproduced, new | regression class (old engine had no identity-bounds emitter) | **blocker** → ✅ [#379](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/379) |
| P2a | `relam` / `reltablespace` invisible to diff | real, tracked | shared pre-existing gap | subsumed by the Wave 3 entries above |
| P2b | `pg_parameter_acl` (PG15+) silently dropped | real, untracked | shared pre-existing gap | probe + docs → ✅ [#380](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/380) |
| P2c | identity sequence grants | not a bug | identical behavior in old engine | **closed won't-fix** |
| P3 | no outside-observer verification gate | absent | never existed in either engine | post-cutover — tracked in [backlog.md](backlog.md) § Validation |

Notes:

- **P1a/P1b (#379):** one corpus scenario
  (`identity-operations--widen-identity-column`) turned both RED; the fix gates
  the `DROP DEFAULT` sandwich on the SOURCE-side column being neither identity
  nor generated, and folds the identity bounds specs after the `TYPE` statement
  when both deltas land on one column fact. A **third defect** surfaced during
  RED: the `USING` cast is illegal on generated columns, and those do NOT route
  through replace (the generation expression renders identically across the
  type change, so only a `type` delta exists) — `USING` is now omitted for
  source-generated columns, `rewriteRisk` retained.
- **P2b (#380):** `pg_parameter_acl` was neither a fact nor in the
  `unmodeled_kind` probe list — silently invisible, violating the completeness
  module's own contract. Now a probe (with `minVersion` version gating);
  modeling the grant as a fact remains add-when-needed.
- **P2c rationale:** grant handling on identity sequences is byte-identical to
  the legacy engine's behavior; the review confirmed there is no defect to fix.
- **Still open (discovered during #379):** a desired identity bound pinned
  exactly at the source type's max (e.g. `bigint … (MAXVALUE 2147483647)` from
  an `integer` identity) produces **no** `identity` delta, yet PostgreSQL
  re-derives the bound on retype — invisible drift. Needs a synthesized bounds
  delta at extract/diff time when the column type changes.
- **Cutover bar:** merge #379/#380, then the standing validation gates in
  [backlog.md](backlog.md) (generative soak at quota, real-world shakedown,
  scope statement).

## PR #368 review triage (Codex) — `schema export` out-dir hardening (deferred by design)

PR #368 (case-twin export path collisions, issue #365) went through ~12 rounds
of automated Codex review. The core fix and its load-bearing consequences were
kept; a large writer-hardening layer that grew out of the loop was **removed
before merge, deliberately**. This section is the record — if an automated
review re-flags one of these, reply with a link here instead of re-fixing.

**Kept (in the PR):** case-collision folding (canonical member spelling per
segment; twins share one file), file-grain cycle handling (two-grain
`cyclicForeignKeys` + `mergeDependencyCycles` — without these, merged files
provably wedge the raw loader), dot-encoding in `seg()` (`Foo.fk` →
`Foo%2Efk.sql`; reserves the `.sql`/`.fk.sql` suffix namespace and fixes a
pre-existing bug where a table named `*.fk` received the FK-split header),
240-byte segment / 255-byte ordered-name clamps (ENAMETOOLONG for dot-rich
group names), and `resolve(outRoot)` in `writeExportFiles` (pre-existing
relative-`--out-dir` prune misbehavior).

**Removed (the deferred hardening layer).** The writer's contract is: **the
export owns every destination it writes**; only *out-of-set* `.sql` files get
the unmanaged refusal (`--prune-unmanaged` to override). This matches
pre-#368 behavior and tools like `tar -x` into a user-chosen directory. The
review loop demanded stronger guarantees for destinations whose *spelling* the
PR introduced (fold-composed paths, dot-encoded names, clamped names), and the
resulting subsystem (~350 lines) was cut because it hardened only the new
spellings to a standard the rest of the writer has never met:

- **In-set overwrite protection** — refusing a pre-existing, not-manifest-owned
  file at a destination the export is about to write (per-file
  `needsOwnershipCheck` marks, lstat probes, guard-before-prune ordering).
- **Symlink/entry attacks inside `--out-dir`** — non-following existence
  probes, top-down ancestor scans rejecting symlinked/non-directory ancestors,
  link-only deletion under `--prune-unmanaged`. Threat model: someone plants
  entries inside your own export directory; if an attacker can do that, the
  pre-existing writer was equally exposed at every old spelling.
- **Case-alias ownership on APFS/NTFS upgrades** — dev+ino identity so a
  manifest path differing only by case counts as owned. Without it, the first
  re-export over a pre-#368 corrupted directory may need `--prune-unmanaged`
  once (fail-closed, self-healing).

If out-dir hardening is ever wanted, do it as a deliberate, whole-writer design
(uniform policy for ALL destinations, not per-spelling marks) — the removed
implementation and its tests live in the PR #368 history up to commit
`176c843` for reference. Known accepted consequences until then: a
hand-authored file placed at exactly a managed object's export path is
overwritten without refusal (as before #368), and exports into directories
containing symlinks follow them (as before #368).

**Meta-lesson (also in AGENTS.md):** cap automated-review iterations. Each
round's finding was locally valid, but the sum re-litigated the writer's
contract one exotic corner at a time. When a bot's findings drift from the
issue's scope — or start finding bugs only in the previous round's fix — stop
patching, decide the contract explicitly, and record it here.

## PR #379 review triage (Codex) — identity columns through a type change

PR #379 made identity/generated columns survive a `type` change. Two Codex P1
findings were fixed in the PR (the `DROP DEFAULT` gate now reads the *desired*
identity side; identity bounds move *before* the `TYPE` when narrowing — both
covered by corpus scenarios `identity-operations--add-identity-with-type-change`
and `identity-operations--widen-identity-explicit-bounds`). Two adjacent corners
are **deliberately deferred** — they are pre-existing ordering gaps that the PR
merely brings within reach, not defects in what it adds. If an automated review
re-flags one, link here instead of re-fixing.

- **Adding identity to a NULLABLE plain column fails.** Identity columns are
  implicitly `NOT NULL`, so the plan carries both an `identity` add and a
  `notNull` set. The differ emits a fact's attributes alphabetically
  (`identity` < `notNull`), so `ADD … AS IDENTITY` runs first and PostgreSQL
  rejects it on a nullable column. This is the same emission-order gap as the
  fixed `type` case, but fixing it needs the `notNull` rule to know an identity
  add is pending (or an ordering edge between two attribute deltas on one fact)
  — a broader change than this PR's scope. Workaround: declare the source column
  `NOT NULL`. The new corpus scenario does exactly that, deliberately.

- **Plain column → identity with inline bounds exceeding the CURRENT column
  type fails.** `ADD … AS IDENTITY (MAXVALUE 5000000000)` on an `integer` column
  that is *also* widening to `bigint` in the same plan is rejected at the ADD:
  inline identity options are validated against the not-yet-retyped column, and
  the `identity` delta orders before the `type` delta. The narrowing fix does
  not cover this because there are no source bounds to move — the bounds arrive
  inline with the ADD. A fix would have to split the ADD into a bare
  `ADD … AS IDENTITY` plus a post-retype chained `SET`, i.e. teach
  `identity.alter` about a concurrent widening; deferred until a real schema
  needs it.

## PR #383 review triage (Codex) — `partitionOf` policy predicate

Codex reviewed #383 while the PR was still mis-based against `main`, so the
diff it saw was the entire delta-next rewrite, not the PR's six files. All
four findings target pre-existing engine code the PR never touches — none is
a defect in what the PR adds — so per the automated-review scope rule they
are recorded here instead of fixed there. If a re-review re-flags one, link
to this section.

- **P1 — `CONCURRENTLY` splice in `src/plan/rules/indexes.ts` "violates the
  no-regex-transform rule".** Pre-existing behavior of the opt-in
  `concurrentIndexes` serialize param. The splice is an anchored prefix
  rewrite inserting an execution modifier that `pg_get_indexdef` can never
  emit (CONCURRENTLY is an execution choice, not catalog state) — it never
  changes what the index *is*, only how it is built, and partitioned parents
  are already exempted. Arguably still a doctrinal wart: a cleaner shape
  would render the statement from structured state. Revisit only if the
  splice ever misfires on a real `def`; not a #383 concern.

- **P2 — `pg_publication_rel` dependencies resolve to the parent publication,
  not the `publicationRel` member (`src/extract/dependencies.ts`, `pubrel`
  CTE).** Plausible: a PG15+ member column list / row filter depending on a
  function or type that is replaced would not rebuild the member, and a
  planned function drop could fail at apply. Pre-existing extraction
  behavior; needs a repro (corpus scenario with a row-filtered publication
  member whose function is replaced) before a fix. Same family as the
  member-grain work in #370.

- **P1 — `databaseScratch` emptiness guard counts only `pg_class` rows
  (`src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts`).** Plausible: a scratch shadow
  pre-populated with only non-relation objects (enum, function, empty user
  schema, …) passes the guard and contaminates the loaded desired state. The
  guard should sweep every managed catalog outside the allowed seeded
  schemas. Pre-existing frontend hardening; needs its own RED test.

- **P2 — composite retype guard rejects a plan that adds the FIRST column of
  the retyped composite (`src/plan/rules/types.ts`).** Plausible
  over-rejection: the guard reads desired-side columns, but PostgreSQL only
  forbids `ALTER TYPE … ALTER ATTRIBUTE` while a column already exists —
  distinguishing source-side users from newly-added columns (and ordering
  those creates after the retype) would admit a valid migration. Pre-existing
  planner conservatism: it fails loud, never corrupts. Fix when a real schema
  hits it.

## PR #388 review triage (Codex) — plan compaction (constraint folds, grant merges)

Codex reviewed #388 while the PR was briefly based against `main` (before the
retarget to `feat/pg-delta-next`), so the diff it saw was the entire delta-next
engine, not the PR's compaction/formatter files. All seven findings target
`src/extract/**` / `load-sql-files.ts` — code the PR never touches — so per the
automated-review scope rule they are recorded, not fixed there. Six of seven are
re-issues of entries already in this ledger (ICU collation rules `3537805075`,
membership SET/INHERIT `3530186654`, `rolconnlimit` `3530186736`, matview
populated state `3530186683`, the `databaseScratch` emptiness guard, range
CANONICAL, subscription `failover` `3537910587`); the ONE new fragment —
subscription `password_required` — is recorded in the extract-completeness list
above. Consolidated for the fidelity-hardening milestone as **Linear CLI-2134**.

## PR #390 review triage (Codex) — jit-disable privilege guard, hash-memo budget

Two Codex findings on PR #390 (extraction-time perf work) were fixed in the PR:
the `SET LOCAL jit = off` pin now degrades gracefully instead of aborting
extraction when the connecting role lacks SET privilege on `jit`
(`src/extract/extract.ts`, mirrored in `src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts`), and
`src/core/hash.ts`'s canonical-string memo no longer retains an individually
oversized key past its advertised total-length budget. One further finding is
**deferred, won't-fix in #390**:

- **WeakMap identity cache can serve a stale digest if a payload object is
  mutated after hashing (`src/core/hash.ts`, `payloadHashes`).** Payload
  mutation after hashing is outside the supported contract — the invariant is
  documented at the `payloadHashes` declaration ("a payload object is never
  mutated after it has first been hashed... every transform that changes one
  returns a NEW object"). Every internal site was audited: the one rewriting
  site (`plan/identity-normalize.ts`'s `normalizePayload`) allocates fresh
  objects rather than mutating in place. And the proof loop (`src/proof/
  prove.ts`) re-extracts applied state with FRESH objects on every run, so a
  stale-hash-induced wrong plan would fail the proof rather than pass
  silently. Revisit only if the public API is ever changed to document
  payload mutability as supported.

## PR #391 review triage — pg_cron username elision

- **Deferred — export-resolved default owner is not threaded into pg_cron
  rendering.** `buildSchemaExport` resolves a per-export owner (`defaultOwner`
  option → profile default → `datdba`; `src/frontends/schema-export.ts:40-111`)
  that can diverge from the handler's configured `defaultJobOwner`; a cron job
  owned by that resolved role still renders an explicit username and needs a
  superuser executor. Deferred because it requires threading export-time
  context into intent rendering (rejected as disproportionate in this PR's
  design); the capture-time `intent-privileged` warning already fires for
  exactly this divergence, so the failure is pre-announced. Revisit if a real
  profile hits it.


## PR #401 review triage (Codex) — wrappers-FDW suppression

Two findings on the CLI-1470 fix. P1 was fixed in the PR; P2 is recorded here.

- **Fixed (P1) — bare `DROP EXTENSION "wrappers"` when the desired state
  omits the dashboard-installed extension.** With wrappers-provisioned FDWs
  projected out (Rule 6c), keeping the extension itself managed planned a
  bare drop that PostgreSQL rejects (the suppressed FDW still depends on the
  extension's handler/validator functions). Fix: `wrappers` joined
  `SUPABASE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS` — it is dashboard-installed, never declared in
  user schema files, so the same platform judgment as `pg_graphql` (#5555)
  applies; the extension and its FDWs are now assumed-present together.

- **Deferred (P2) — `isNamedObjectPredicate()` / `containsWildcardMatcher()`
  do not inspect `edgeTo`, so a concrete `edgeTo: { name: "wrappers" }`
  selector in a CUSTOM policy without explicit `audit` metadata defaults to
  the `suspicious` projection-audit classification.** Deferred by design
  judgment, not oversight: no `edgeTo` form was ever classified as a
  named-object selector (including a concrete `schema`), and the default is
  arguably correct — an edge-based rule pins a concrete *provenance*, not
  concrete named objects; it still excludes an unbounded class of dependents
  (every FDW depending on `wrappers`), which is exactly what the audit's
  "suspicious" bucket exists to surface. `suspicious` is a review flag, not
  a behavior change, and explicit `audit` metadata (which the Supabase rule
  supplies) is the intended escape hatch for a policy author who has made
  the judgment deliberately. Revisit only if a real custom-policy consumer
  hits audit friction with a pinned edgeTo selector.

- **Deferred (round 2, P2) — declarative `CREATE EXTENSION wrappers` is not
  emitted for a target that lacks it.** True, and identical to the other four
  `SUPABASE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS` entries: the platform list makes an extension
  invisible in BOTH directions, so a user-declared platform extension is
  never created either. The finding's failure mode ("retained user objects
  that depend on its members fail during apply") has no instance under this
  policy: the only objects that depend on wrappers members are FDWs built
  from its handlers, which Rule 6c deliberately removes from the managed
  surface (their servers / foreign tables / user mappings cascade out). The
  fair kernel is that `wrappers` is CONDITIONALLY present (installed when a
  dashboard integration is enabled) while the other entries are
  image-provisioned — that conditionality is exactly the known name-list
  limitation the policy header documents; the committed Supabase baseline
  (docs/roadmap/backlog.md) is the mechanism that can distinguish
  "present on this target" from "assumed by name" and is the revisit path.

- **Deferred (round 3, P1) — a kept user object over a suppressed wrapper
  prerequisite plans SQL that fails at apply.** Tracked as CLI-2178 (pg-delta
  1.0.0 stable release project). Reproduced (2026-08-11): a
  `dsl_owner` view over a foreign table on a suppressed wrappers FDW plans
  `CREATE VIEW public.paying_users AS SELECT … FROM stripe.customers` with no
  prerequisite and no plan-time diagnostic — `excludeFactsAndDescendants`
  prunes by parent descent only, and the view's `depends` edge drops with its
  endpoint, so apply fails on any target lacking the dashboard integration.
  Valid, but the gap is a PRE-EXISTING property of every policy suppression
  of non-schema-keyed objects (an `supabase_admin`-owned FDW chain has the
  identical behavior today); this PR widens its reach to the real Cloud
  ownership rather than introducing it. The PR is still strictly net-positive:
  before it, EVERY integration-bearing project planned unreplayable
  `CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER` DDL; after it, only the dependent-view subset
  still fails, and one step later. A principled fix is architecturally
  significant and general, not wrappers-specific: either (a) reference-only
  semantics for suppressed prerequisite chains + shadow-seed materialization
  (the `auth.users`-trigger mechanism, but keyed on objects rather than
  assumed schemas — needs seed-side support to materialize a foreign table
  whose server/extension are also suppressed), or (b) a plan-time
  "suppressed prerequisite" diagnostic: the projection-suppression collector
  already records every suppressed fact with attribution, so `plan()` can
  cross-check kept deltas' extraction-time edges against it and escalate
  warning→fatal exactly when a delta touches a stranded consumer (the
  `USER_MAPPING_UNREADABLE` precedent). Option (b) is the cheaper first step
  and benefits every suppression rule, not just Rule 6c.

## PR #403 review triage — the reserved `_custom/` folder

Round-1 findings were fixed in the PR (migration references must resolve to a
FILE, the pruner skips `_custom/` during traversal instead of after the walk and
no longer swallows FS errors, `COMMENT` left the modeled-kind allowlist,
`unmodeled_drift` diffs fully qualified identities, the `unmodeled_kind`
remediation is per kind, and `listCustomFiles` propagates non-ENOENT failures).
One finding is **deferred, won't-fix in #403**:

- **Foreign tables (and `SECURITY LABEL`) cannot be flagged by
  `custom_modeled_kind`.** pg-topo has no statement class for either — both
  classify as `UNKNOWN` (verified against the current classifier), and
  `_custom/` deliberately suppresses the `UNKNOWN_STATEMENT_CLASS` lint, so a
  `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` parked in the reserved folder is hidden entirely even
  though pg-delta models foreign tables and will regenerate one into the managed
  tree. The correct fix is adding `CreateForeignTableStmt` / `SecurityLabelStmt`
  classes to pg-topo's classifier (`packages/pg-topo/src/classify/`) and listing
  them in `MODELED_STATEMENT_CLASSES`
  (`packages/pg-delta/src/frontends/custom-lint.ts`) — a cross-package change,
  out of scope for #403. Deferred rather than dropped because the failure mode
  today is LOUD, not silent: the duplicate `CREATE` makes the next
  export-then-apply fail to converge on the shadow load
  (`max_rounds_exceeded`), which is exactly the hazard the lint rule
  pre-announces rather than the hazard it prevents.

  Third instance of the same classifier-coverage gap (round-3 review
  finding): pg-topo has no class for `DropStmt` either, so a modeled DROP
  (`DROP TABLE …`, `DROP VIEW …`, etc.) parked in `_custom/` also classifies
  `UNKNOWN` and is hidden by the same `UNKNOWN_STATEMENT_CLASS` suppression
  — `custom_modeled_kind` cannot flag it because it never sees a
  drop-target class to compare against `MODELED_STATEMENT_CLASSES`. The
  hazard shape differs slightly from the create case: a create-then-drop of
  the same object in the shadow (the `_custom/` file creates it, the
  managed tree no longer does) makes the plan schedule dropping the LIVE
  object, not just fail to converge — though this is additionally gated by
  `--allow-data-loss` at apply time, so not silent either. Same correct fix:
  add drop-target statement classes to pg-topo's classifier
  (`packages/pg-topo/src/classify/`) and list them alongside the
  create-target classes in `MODELED_STATEMENT_CLASSES`
  (`packages/pg-delta/src/frontends/custom-lint.ts`). Bundling this with the
  foreign-table / `SECURITY LABEL` fix above is the efficient path, since
  all three land in the same two files.

- **The scratch-loader cluster-DDL preflight does not catch
  `GRANT … ON PARAMETER` (pre-existing).** Discovered while verifying the
  round-1 P1: the preflight's GRANT pattern
  (`src/frontends/load-sql-files.ts:415`,
  `/^\s*grant\b(?![\s\S]*\bon\b)/i`) deliberately exempts privilege grants,
  so `GRANT SET ON PARAMETER … TO …` loads into a co-located
  (`databaseScratch`) shadow and writes to `pg_parameter_acl` — a SHARED
  cluster catalog — while the scratch guard snapshots/restores only
  `pg_roles`/`pg_auth_members`. A plan/dry-run can therefore leave a
  parameter ACL behind on the live cluster. #403 removed the advice that
  steered users toward this (the `unmodeled_kind` remediation is now
  per-kind and never points cluster-shared kinds at `_custom/`), but the
  loader gap predates the PR and applies to any `.sql` in the tree.
  Follow-up: extend the preflight to refuse parameter-ACL grants (and audit
  for other shared-catalog writers, e.g. `ALTER ROLE … SET` is already
  covered?) in `databaseScratch` mode, or widen the snapshot/restore to
  `pg_parameter_acl`.

Round-4 findings (loop capped here per the automated-review policy — both are
re-litigations of already-resolved threads one corner deeper, under
user-constructed pathological setups):

- **Deferred — drift identity serialization is not injective for dotted
  quoted identifiers (Codex P2, round 4).** `probeUnmodeledIdentities`
  renders type/name components with plain `%s`-style joins, so `"a.b".c`
  and `a."b.c"` flatten identically and a pathological same-rendering pair
  across shadow/target can mask an `unmodeled_drift` warning. Accepted:
  the diagnostic is best-effort observability — a masked warning still
  fails loudly when the generated migration runs — and the setup requires
  dots inside quoted identifiers colliding across two databases. Fix if
  ever needed: quote each component (`quote_ident`/`%I`) in the identity
  projections (`src/extract/unmodeled.ts`).
- **Deferred — dangling `_custom/README.md` symlink bypasses the scaffold
  containment (Codex P2, round 4).** Round 3 fixed the symlinked `_custom`
  root; a dangling symlink at the leaf README path still lets
  `writeFileSync` create the file outside `outRoot` (`existsSync` is false
  for dangling links). One-line fix when next touched: create with the
  exclusive `wx` flag (O_CREAT|O_EXCL does not follow symlinks) in
  `scaffoldCustomReadme` (`src/frontends/custom-dir.ts`) and treat EEXIST
  as skip.

## PR #407 review triage (Codex) — platform-provisioned assumed-schema members

Context: PR #407 exempts platform-provisioned members of assumed schemas
(system-role-owned, e.g. `supabase_functions.http_request()`) from the
action-graph missing-requirement guard, so a DB-webhook trigger plans against
a target that has never had webhooks provisioned (Sentry SUPABASE-API-8CX).
Two round-2 findings were fixed in the PR (run-level `defaultOwner` override
excluded from provenance; descendant closure). One is **deferred by design**:

- **Deferred — the plan neither creates the platform object nor proves against
  a target that lacks it ("materialize the dependency before bypassing the
  guard", Codex P1).** Deliberate: the policy's managed view EXCLUDES platform
  objects — a user plan must never `CREATE SCHEMA supabase_functions` /
  `CREATE FUNCTION … http_request` (it may lack the privileges and would claim
  platform state as user state). "Assumed present" is the same contract as
  `assumedRoles`/`assumedSchemas`: a plan with `GRANT … TO anon` or
  `CREATE EXTENSION … SCHEMA extensions` equally fails on a target where the
  platform never provisioned those; the platform (mgmt-api / Supabase image
  migrations) owns provisioning, outside the plan. Consequence, accepted: an
  `apply()`/`provePlan()` run against a bare clone that lacks the webhooks
  infra fails at the CREATE TRIGGER — the same failure mode the other assumed
  kinds already have. Revisit only alongside the committed Supabase baseline
  (docs/roadmap/backlog.md), which is the mechanism that could seed platform
  objects into proof clones for all assumed kinds at once.

Round-4 findings (loop capped here per the automated-review policy — both are
contract re-litigation of the provenance heuristic under hypothetical setups,
not defects reachable on the shipped policy):

- **Deferred — explicit platform-owner designation instead of
  `assumedRoles \ {policy.defaultOwner}` (Codex P1, round 4).** The heuristic
  treats a policy-assumed role other than the policy's own declared default
  owner as a platform object owner within assumed schemas. For the shipped
  Supabase policy this is exact (`assumedRoles` = SUPABASE_SYSTEM_ROLES +
  `postgres`, `defaultOwner: postgres`). A CUSTOM policy that added a user
  role to `assumedRoles` would widen the exemption to that role's objects in
  assumed schemas. No shipped or known custom policy does this; the clean fix
  is a new `Policy` field (e.g. `platformObjectOwners`) — an API addition
  disproportionate to this bug fix. Revisit when a custom-policy consumer
  actually declares assumed user roles.

- **Refuted for the shipped policy — descendant closure covering "user-added"
  children of platform tables (Codex P1, round 4).** The claimed
  counterexample (a user-added `auth.users.custom_flag` column) is not
  creatable on Supabase: `ADD COLUMN` / `CREATE INDEX` / `ADD CONSTRAINT` /
  `CREATE POLICY` all require table OWNERSHIP, which the user's `postgres`
  lacks on system-role-owned tables. The one user-creatable child — a trigger,
  via the grantable TRIGGER privilege — is deliberately MANAGED (policy
  include rule 3), so the plan PRODUCES it and the requirement guard never
  consults the exemption for it. Desired-only FILTERED descendants of a
  platform root can therefore only be platform-made (image upgrade), which is
  exactly what the exemption must cover. Revisit together with the explicit
  platform-owner designation above if any platform grants users DDL on
  platform-owned relations.

## PR #412 review triage (Codex) — libpq sslmode semantics

Context: PR #412 restores the legacy engine's `sslmode` translation for
URL-based connections (`parseSslConfig`), fixing `sslmode=require` against
private-CA servers (CLI-2176). The MIGRATION.md pool-construction example was
fixed in the PR (round 1). Two findings are **deferred by design**:

- **Deferred — `sslmode=require` does not read `PGDELTA_*_SSLROOTCERT` env
  content (Codex P1, round 1).** Deliberate legacy parity, asserted by a
  dedicated unit test ("require does NOT read the env CA"). libpq's upgrade
  rule ("require behaves as verify-ca") triggers on a root CA *file*; the
  role-scoped env var is pg-delta's own PEM-content extension and env vars are
  ambient across invocations. Honoring it under `require` would let a CA set
  for one server silently enable chain verification against a different
  server whose URL carries `sslmode=require` (the standard Supabase URL
  shape), breaking connections that work today. Users who want env-CA
  verification say so with `sslmode=verify-ca`. Revisit only if consumers ask
  for an explicit opt-in (e.g. a parse option), not by flipping the default.
- **Deferred — `sslmode=prefer` does not fall back to plaintext when the
  server refuses TLS (Codex P2, round 1).** node-postgres has no
  per-connection retry, so a single pool config cannot express libpq's
  try-SSL-then-plaintext. node-postgres' native `prefer` handling, upstream
  pg-connection-string's `uselibpqcompat` mode, and the legacy engine all
  force TLS identically; a bespoke connect-retry wrapper in `makePool` is
  disproportionate. Documented as a limitation in the module header and
  MIGRATION.md. Revisit if node-postgres grows native fallback support.

## PR #410 review triage (Codex) — extension-replace member handling

Rounds 1–2 were real defects in the PR's own changes and were fixed in-PR
with RED-first regressions (member-satellite removal cycle, traverse-through
for member dependents, member-satellite replay, vanish-gate scoped to
`memberOfExtension` edges into destroyed extensions). Round 3 re-litigates a
pre-existing contract corner; loop capped here per the automated-review
policy.

- **Deferred — renamed dependents escape the forced-rebuild walk (Codex P1,
  round 3).** With `renames: "auto"`, `expandReplacements`' dependent check
  (`desired.has(edge.from)`) sees only the dependent's NEW id, so a dependent
  being renamed in the same plan is never rebuilt around a destroyed
  dependency — e.g. renaming a table whose column uses an extension-owned
  type while that extension is replaced yields `ALTER TABLE … RENAME` +
  `DROP EXTENSION` and PostgreSQL rejects the drop. This gap PREDATES PR
  #410 and is not extension-specific: the same shape exists for a rename
  crossing an enum/type replace (the walk has never carried the
  accepted-rename identity mapping). The clean fix is to thread
  `acceptedRenames` into `ReplacementExpansionInput` and translate ids during
  the walk — or to refuse the plan when a renamed dependent would need a
  rebuild (rename + rebuild of the same object in one plan is currently
  unexpressible). Disproportionate to the pg_net cycle fix; needs its own
  RED coverage for the rename × forced-rebuild matrix.

## PR #418 review triage (Codex) — planId content hash

Context: PR #418 adds required `Plan.planId` (WP1). Threat model: planId is an
**integrity check against accidental divergence** (stale/hand-edited artifacts
drifting from what was approved), NOT a security boundary — `computePlanId` is
a public export, so a deliberate artifact editor can always re-stamp. Findings
whose only failure scenario is a malicious editor gain nothing from hashing.

Fixed in the PR (rounds 1–3): preamble bound into the digest (it is executed
per segment — run content); `ENGINE_VERSION` bumped to 0.3.0 so pre-planId
executors fail closed on stamped artifacts; `assertPlanId` preflight added to
`provePlan()` so every public execution path validates before clone work.

- **Deferred — bind `projectionAudit` into planId (Codex P1, round 2).** The
  audit is gate INPUT under `prove --strict-audit`, so it is the one remaining
  field that neither fails loud nor is reporting-only. Not hashed yet because
  (a) the only exploit path is a deliberate editor (re-stampable → no
  adversarial gain), and (b) `parsePlan` runs `normalizeProjectionAudit`
  BEFORE the digest check, so inclusion requires proving normalize-stability
  between `plan()` output and re-parsed artifacts — a false "re-plan" reject
  is the worst failure mode this feature can have. If revisited: hash the
  NORMALIZED form on both sides and extend the round-trip suite with
  audit-bearing plans.
- **Declined — bind `source.endpointHash`/`source.identity` into planId
  (Codex P1, round 2).** These are transport stamps the CLI attaches AFTER
  `plan()` precisely so planId stays a transport-independent content
  identity (same plan against two replicas must share an id). They defend
  against accidental endpoint mixups (`prove --clone "$SOURCE_URL"`), which
  do not involve artifact editing; the described bypass requires a deliberate
  editor, who re-stamps.
- **Declined — bind `baseline.digest` into planId (Codex P2, round 2).**
  Baseline already fails loud on accidental drift: apply/prove reconcile the
  live-resolved baseline against the stamped digest (even under `--force`).
  The described bypass needs a deliberate two-step edit — re-stampable.
- **Declined — `major` changeset (Codex P1, round 1).** The package is on a
  0.x pre/alpha train (every bump releases as `-alpha.N`); the repo has never
  queued a `major`, and doing so would promote pg-delta to 1.0.0 the day
  `changeset pre exit` runs — a release-train side effect worse than the
  labeling nit. Breaking-in-alpha ships as `minor` here by established
  practice.
## CLI-2054 triage — pgmq intent capture and replay

- **RESOLVED in-PR — `plan()` now has a collision-scoped
  `intent-unsupported` gate** (Codex round-2 P1 sharpened the
  consequence: a regular→partitioned transition of the same queue name
  planned a bare destructive `drop_queue` whose proof falsely converged,
  because the desired re-extract skipped the fact too). It shipped first as
  an unconditional desired-side refusal mirroring the `INTENT_UNKEYED`
  check, then was narrowed to fire only when the opposite side manages a
  fact under the SAME key — an unconditional gate blocked benign diffs whose
  desired state merely contained a partitioned queue. Still open here: whether
  the intervals can be sourced from `part_config` once the pg_partman intent
  handler (CLI-2044) lands, making partitioned queues replayable instead of
  refused.

### PR #399 review triage (Codex)

Fixed: `drop_queue` now reports `lockClass: "accessExclusive"` (it DROPs the
`q_*`/`a_*` relations; the intent adapter's `"none"` default misrepresented a
destructive drop as lock-free in the safety report).

Deferred (recorded here, not fixed in the PR):

- **Old-pgmq catalog shapes are not probed.** `capture()` selects
  `is_partitioned`/`is_unlogged` from `pgmq.meta` unconditionally; a pgmq
  older than 0.31 (mid-2023, before those columns existed) fails extraction
  with a loud `undefined_column` naming `pgmq.meta`. Every pgmq Supabase has
  ever shipped (≥1.4) has both columns, so this is unreachable on the
  Supabase profile; it needs a raw/custom profile composed against a 3+
  year old pgmq. The failure is loud and actionable (upgrade pgmq or drop
  the handler from the profile), and pg-cron makes the same
  stable-catalog-shape assumption. Revisit only if a real profile hits it:
  the fix shape is a column-presence probe degrading to filter-only capture
  with a diagnostic.
- **User DDL referencing operational queue tables can order before the
  replay.** A user view/FK on `pgmq.q_<name>` has its dependency edge pruned
  when `resolveView` projects the `managedBy` table out, and intent replay
  sorts late (weight 90), so a from-empty apply can attempt the view before
  `pgmq.create()`. Referencing pgmq's operational tables in own DDL is
  discouraged upstream; before this PR the same desired state was strictly
  worse (no replay existed at all — the table never appeared); the
  declarative path converges through the loader's retry rounds and the
  plan/apply path fails LOUDLY via the proof, never silently. The clean fix
  (remap pruned dependency edges onto the intent fact before projection) is
  planner/resolveView machinery — deferred as its own design piece (the
  desired-side `intent-unsupported` plan() gate, originally bucketed with
  it, shipped in-PR after the round-2 P1).
- **Partitioned-queue interplay with `DROP EXTENSION pgmq`.** A partitioned
  queue emits no intent fact, so a desired state that removes pgmq relies on
  member-cascade to take the operational tables with it. Partitioned queues
  are already explicitly unmanaged (`intent-unsupported`); their removal
  semantics belong to the same follow-up that makes them replayable
  (part_config-sourced intervals, above), not to this PR.
Also fixed after the round-3 triage:

- **Partitioned→regular transition of the same queue name (Codex round 3) —
  now FIXED.** Source has a partitioned queue `X` (skipped, source-side
  diagnostic), desired declares a regular queue `X` (fact). The plan emitted
  `pgmq.create('X')`, which no-ops against the existing registration (pgmq's
  create is `IF NOT EXISTS`), so apply/proof failed to converge — loudly, via
  the proof backstop, but with a confusing fingerprint mismatch instead of a
  plan-time error. Originally declined because an early rejection needed
  source-side diagnostics to carry the queue key plus a diagnostic × opposite-
  side join in `plan()`. That machinery was then built anyway to
  COLLISION-SCOPE the desired-side gate (which was too strict — it blocked any
  diff whose desired state merely contained a partitioned queue), so the
  mirror-image direction came free: the same key-carrying context and the same
  `FactBase.has` probe, run the other way round. Both directions now throw at
  plan time naming the ext/intentKind/key and which side holds the unreplayable
  form. The residual corner (making partitioned queues replayable via
  part_config-sourced intervals) is still the follow-up above.

Round 4 (final round — loop capped per the automated-review policy):

- **Changeset overclaimed the raw profile's safety (Codex round 4) — FIXED.**
  The release note said "a `raw` or custom profile never plans `DROP TABLE`"
  against the operational tables, but `rawProfile` is `handlers: []` and never
  invokes the handler, so under `--profile raw` a source-to-empty diff still
  treats `pgmq.q_*`/`a_*` as ordinary managed tables. Reworded to scope the
  guarantee to profiles that compose the handler.
- **The `INTENT_UNSUPPORTED` collision gate probes PRE-filter fact bases
  (Codex round 4) — declined, recorded.** `plan()` checks
  `rawSource.has(id)` / `rawDesired.has(id)` before `buildChangeSet` applies
  policy or baseline projection, so a profile that composes `pgmqHandler`
  while simultaneously policy-filtering its intent facts would be over-blocked
  even though the filtered diff would produce no action. Declined because the
  configuration is contrived (a user wanting queues unmanaged simply omits the
  opt-in handler), the failure direction is fail-safe (planning refuses with a
  clear message naming the queue; no wrong DDL is emitted), and the placement
  mirrors the pre-existing `INTENT_UNKEYED` gate directly above it. If a real
  profile ever hits the over-block, the fix shape is to move the probe onto
  the kept-delta / managed views, mirroring the `USER_MAPPING_UNREADABLE`
  gate's zero-over-block approach lower in the same function.


## CLI-2044 triage — pg_partman `create_parent` intent capture and replay

- **Deferred — the DROP path needs a second sync round to converge.**
  Deregistering a parent is `DELETE FROM part_config` (`dataLoss: "none"`).
  There is no single-statement inverse of `create_parent`: `undo_partition()`
  requires a separate `p_target_table` to move rows into and is batched by
  `p_loop_count` (verified on pg_partman 5.3.1), so it cannot be rendered as a
  replay. The consequence is deliberate: once the `part_config` row is gone the
  premade children and the template table lose their `managedBy` tag and become
  ORDINARY user tables, which the plan — computed before that projection change
  — did not account for, so a one-shot `apply` leaves them behind and its proof
  reports drift. A second sync round then drops them explicitly under the normal
  data-loss gate. The alternative (an opaque `DO` block that mass-`DROP TABLE`s
  every descendant) was rejected: it would destroy partition data the user never
  saw planned. A converging one-shot drop needs the planner to re-project after
  an intent removal, which is planner machinery this slice deliberately left
  alone. Covered by an explicit assertion in
  `tests/extension-intent-partman.test.ts` ("drop: an unregistered desired state
  DEREGISTERS the parent without destroying a single partition"), which asserts
  the true two-round behaviour rather than a false convergence.

- **Deferred — sub-partitioned sets are scoped out, not replayed.** A
  `create_sub_parent` set writes a `part_config_sub` row on the top parent AND a
  partman-authored `part_config` row per sub-parent. Neither is a faithful
  `create_parent` replay, so both emit `INTENT_UNSUPPORTED` and no fact (their
  partitions stay `managedBy` at every level, so nothing is ever dropped).
  Replaying them needs a second intent kind driven by `part_config_sub` plus
  ordering between the two levels. Same fail-loud gap as pgmq's partitioned
  queues: a sub-partitioned set declared in the DESIRED state is silently left
  unmanaged rather than failing the plan — see the CLI-2054 triage above, whose
  `plan()`-level `intent-unsupported` gate would cover this case too.

- **Deferred — customizations to partman's AUTO-created template table are not
  captured.** `<partman_schema>.template_<parent_schema>_<parent_name>` is tagged
  `managedBy` and recreated by `create_parent`, so an index or default a user
  added to it is lost on a rebuild. Not fixed here because leaving it as an
  exported fact creates a worse failure: `create_parent` creates it
  `IF NOT EXISTS`, so under the default by-object export layout the later
  `CREATE TABLE` fails permanently with "already exists" and no retry round can
  recover. Users who need a customized template should supply their own via
  `p_template_table` — that path keeps full fidelity and is `consumes`-ordered.

- **Note for CLI-2054 (pgmq partitioned queues).** The CLI-2054 triage above
  anticipated that this handler would make pgmq's partitioned queues replayable
  by sourcing their intervals from `part_config`. That revisit is deliberately
  NOT done here — and after the PR #400 review fix below, pgmq-owned
  `part_config` rows (both the `q_` queue table and the `a_` archive table that
  `pgmq.create_partitioned` registers) are explicitly SKIPPED with an
  `INTENT_UNSUPPORTED` warning rather than captured. Capturing them produced a
  wrong replay: an export / from-empty plan contained
  `create_parent('pgmq.q_x', …)` consuming a table nothing in the plan creates,
  and a live↔live diff whose desired side lacked the queue planned a
  `DELETE FROM part_config` that would disable pgmq's own maintenance. Making
  partitioned queues replayable therefore needs BOTH a pgmq-side intent (the
  intervals re-sourced from `part_config`) and cross-handler ordering — a
  dependency no slice has taken on yet.

## PR #400 review triage (Codex) — pg_partman create_parent intent

Five findings; two fixed in the PR (partman scope only), two deferred here, one
redirected to the pgmq PR (#399).

- **Fixed — pgmq-owned `part_config` rows leaked into create_parent intents
  (P1).** See the reworded CLI-2054 note above for the failure modes. The fix
  resolves pgmq's installed schema from `pg_extension` and skips rows whose
  parent matches a registered queue in `<pgmq_schema>.meta` (both `q_` and `a_`
  prefixes — `create_partitioned` registers TWO parents, verified on pgmq
  1.5.1). Detection must come from the catalog: handler capture runs on the
  RAW pre-projection fact base, so neither fact presence nor cross-handler
  `managedBy` edges can identify the rows.

- **Fixed — `create_parent` under-reported its relation lock (P2).** The
  replay spec inherited the intent-rule default `lockClass: "none"`, but
  `create_parent` takes an explicit `LOCK TABLE … IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE` on
  the parent (`pg_partman--5.3.1.sql:1348`). Now `accessExclusive`. The
  settings `UPDATE` and the deregister `DELETE` stay `"none"` (plain row DML).

- **Deferred — version-keyed handler gating (P1/P2, two findings).** The
  partman capture projects 5.3.1-audited `part_config` columns
  (`time_encoder`, `maintenance_order`, …) and pgmq's projects `is_unlogged`;
  on an older installed extension version the query fails with
  `undefined_column` and aborts extraction instead of degrading to filter-only
  behavior. This is the `versions?` handler field the architecture doc already
  promises (`docs/architecture/extension-intent.md` §risks: "handlers are
  version-keyed; unsupported versions degrade to filter-only with a notice")
  but which was never implemented — and it equally affects the shipped pg_cron
  handler (comment-only "stable since 1.4" posture). Fixing it per-handler
  inside feature PRs is piecemeal hardening of a framework contract; do it
  once, across pg_cron + pgmq + pg_partman: resolve `extversion` in capture,
  compare against a per-handler supported range, and degrade to Phase-A
  tagging plus a diagnostic outside it.

- **Redirected to PR #399 — `pgmq.drop_queue` lock class (P2).** Valid
  one-liner (`drop_queue` drops the queue and archive tables → access
  exclusive), but it is pgmq-handler code owned by the stacked pgmq PR, not
  this one. Landed there (see the PR #399 triage above).

### Round 2 (post-rebase)

Codex's second pass ran against a rebase that had transiently dropped the
round-1 fixes (restored since), so one finding is a stale artifact. The other
two are real but out of this PR's partman scope; recorded here.

- **Stale — "the claimed accessExclusive fix is absent".** True of the
  reviewed commit only: the branch was rebased over the round-1 push before
  the re-review ran. The fix commits are restored on top of the rebase;
  nothing to change.

- **Verified, redirected to the plan/export plumbing — `schema export`
  bypasses the desired-side intent gates.** The chain is real:
  `buildSchemaExport` → `reconstructManagedView` → `resolveView` →
  `buildFactBase` (twice), and `buildFactBase` constructs a fresh
  `FactBase` whose `.diagnostics` is always `[]` (the constructor cannot
  carry them), so by the time `export-sql-files` calls `plan()` the
  desired-side `INTENT_UNKEYED` / `INTENT_UNSUPPORTED` gates read empty
  diagnostics and pass. Consequence: exporting a database that holds an
  unreplayable intent (partitioned pgmq queue, sub-partitioned partman set)
  silently emits an incomplete bare schema instead of failing loudly. NOT
  new to the partman PR — the `INTENT_UNKEYED` gate on main has the same
  hole for pg_cron — and the fix (preserve diagnostics across managed-view
  reconstruction, or evaluate the gate on the pre-projection base) is
  fact-base/plan plumbing shared with the gate that shipped on the pgmq
  side of this stack. Fix it there as its own slice, with an export-path
  regression test.

- **Deferred — arg-backed payload changes on a MATERIALIZED partition set
  do not converge (Codex round 2 raised the `p_default_table` true→false
  corner).** Every intent `payloadAttrs` entry is `"replace"` (drop +
  create), so any arg-backed change replays `DELETE FROM part_config` +
  `create_parent(...)` against a parent whose partitions (and default
  partition) already exist physically. For `defaultTable` specifically the
  replay cannot converge: `create_parent(p_default_table := false)` does
  not remove the existing default partition, and the next capture recomputes
  `defaultTable` from `pg_partitioned_table.partdefid`, so the diff
  reappears (the proof loop reports the drift — the failure is loud, not
  silent). This is one corner of a class: the intent-rule interface has no
  in-place ALTER hook, and the handler's `create()` sees only the desired
  fact, so a faithful transition (`DETACH`/`DROP` of the default partition
  under the data-loss gate) cannot be expressed today. Needs either an
  alter-capable intent rule or a planner-level transition gate — the same
  planner-machinery family as the two-round drop above. Until then the
  supported path for repartitioning a live set is partman's own tooling,
  not a pg-delta replay.

### Round 3

- **Fixed — the changeset's migration snippet called `resolveProfile(profile)`.**
  The real signature is `await resolveProfile(pool, profile)` (async, pool
  first), so a typed caller following the note verbatim failed to compile and
  an untyped one threw at runtime. Snippet corrected in the changeset.

- **Deferred — switching `templateTable` from partman's auto-created template
  to a user-supplied one orphans the old auto template.** A second instance of
  the materialized-set replace class above: the replacement replays
  `DELETE FROM part_config` + `create_parent(p_template_table := …)` without
  touching the old `template_<schema>_<name>` table, which the next capture no
  longer recognises as the configured auto template — it surfaces as an
  ordinary (empty) user table, the proof reports the drift loudly, and the
  second sync round drops it under the normal gate, exactly like the two-round
  deregister path. A faithful one-shot transition needs the same in-place
  ALTER hook / planner transition gate as the `p_default_table` corner, so it
  lands with that machinery, not piecemeal here.

## CLI-2219 cross-review triage — legacy-artifact detection after the `_relocatable` rename

The CLI-2219 fix moved `relocatable` out of the extension fact's hashed
payload (now `_relocatable` metadata). Cross-review confirmed three legacy-
artifact symptoms, all deferred per the established alpha re-capture posture
(precedent: the ENGINE_VERSION 0.2.0 search_path change invalidated every
fact hash with only a "regenerate your artifacts" note; snapshots carry no
engine-version stamp and FORMAT_VERSION describes the document shape, which
is unchanged). All three are documented in the release's changeset note;
none is silent data corruption — but none points the user at re-capture
either, which is the gap to close if pre-fix artifacts turn out to persist
in the wild:

- **Legacy snapshot vs fresh extract** — `plan()` throws the (now
  misleading) guardrail-3 `no rule for attribute 'relocatable'` error for
  every extension the snapshot carries; `pgdelta drift` reports false
  `.relocatable` drift. A decode-time key migration in `snapshot.ts` is
  feasible but must run AFTER digest verification (migrating first changes
  the recomputed rootHash and rejects the file as corrupt) and would be the
  first kind-aware code in the deliberately kind-free core — do it only if a
  consumer that persists v1 snapshots and cannot cheaply re-capture shows up
  (the mgmt-api incident path extracts both sides live).
- **Legacy baseline** — `subtractBaseline` matches on content hash, so a
  pre-fix baseline silently stops subtracting every extension fact (they
  leak back into exports/plans with no diagnostic). No baselines are shipped
  in-repo (the supabase policy's `baseline:` is commented out), so exposure
  is user-supplied only. A fail-loud guard in the same family as the
  documented `redactSecrets`-mismatch check (e.g. flag a baseline whose
  extension facts carry hashed keys the current extractor never emits) would
  convert this to an actionable error.
- **Two legacy snapshots planned against each other** — both sides lack
  `_relocatable`, so a non-relocatable extension's schema move loses the
  replace route and plans `ALTER … SET SCHEMA` (rejected loudly by Postgres
  at apply; `prove` also fails it pre-mutation).

### PR #435 review triage (Codex)

- **Deferred — a relocatability flip BETWEEN plan and apply is invisible to
  the fingerprint gate.** With `_relocatable` outside the hashed surface, an
  out-of-band `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` in the plan→apply window whose new
  version changes nothing catalog-visible except relocatability no longer
  moves `physicalSource.rootHash`, so the apply gate accepts the stale plan.
  This is the same trade the engine already makes for `version` itself (never
  hashed, by design): an update that changes any member definition still
  moves the fingerprint and is caught. The residual failure modes are loud or
  pre-approved — a stale `ALTER … SET SCHEMA` is rejected by Postgres and
  aborts the apply (re-plan resolves it), and executing the plan's
  DROP+CREATE against a now-relocatable extension still converges and only
  carries the dataLoss hazard the operator already accepted at plan time.
  Revalidating planner decision inputs at apply would need a general
  "plan-bound preconditions" channel (per-kind checks in apply are
  architecture-hostile); if that machinery ever lands, extension
  relocatability is its first customer.

- **Deferred — `_relocatable` in a snapshot is outside the digest (round 2,
  same family).** The snapshot digest folds `rootHash`, which excludes all
  `_`-prefixed metadata by the hash.ts contract — so an edited or corrupted
  `_relocatable` (like `_position` or `_configGucs` before it) passes
  `deserializeSnapshot()`. The digest is an integrity guard against
  ACCIDENTAL corruption, not authentication: it is stored in the same file,
  so a deliberate editor can recompute it regardless of what it covers.
  There is also nothing to independently validate against at decode time —
  the flag is control-file state of a database the snapshot may have
  outlived — and re-hashing it reintroduces CLI-2219. Blast radius of a
  wrong value is the same as the plan-to-apply drift entry above: a stale
  ALTER … SET SCHEMA is rejected loudly by Postgres, and an unnecessary
  replace converges with its dataLoss hazard surfaced at plan approval. If a
  "plan-bound decision inputs" channel lands (previous entry), snapshot-side
  authentication of those inputs belongs to the same machinery.

## PR #434 review triage — extension precheck identifier case

- **Deferred — preserve quoted-identifier case in extension shadow prechecks.**
  `findMatchingStatements` keeps quoted identifier text but discards the quote
  delimiters, so case-sensitive user objects such as
  `"Vault"."create_secret"()` or `"Cron"."schedule"()` become indistinguishable
  from the lowercase extension APIs and can trigger a false capability refusal.
  The case requires exact homographs and is unusual enough not to expand PR
  #434. A shared fix must retain quote delimiters for every shadow precheck,
  accept exact lowercase quoted API names, and keep PostgreSQL's case-folding
  behavior for unquoted names.

## PR #444 review triage (Codex) — idempotent export is CREATE EXTENSION only

- **Deferred — `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` for managed install schemas.**
  `--create-extension-if-not-exists` only rewrites `CREATE EXTENSION`. A
  managed non-public install schema (`partman`, a user `app` schema, …) still
  exports as plain `CREATE SCHEMA`, so replaying the whole directory onto a
  cluster that already has that schema fails before the extension no-op.
  `schema apply` does not need this: it diffs and only emits CREATE when the
  object is absent. A general idempotent-DDL export (schema / table / type
  `IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP IF EXISTS`) was an explicit non-goal of #444. If a
  later flag wants full-tree bootstrap replay, start with the schemas that
  `CREATE EXTENSION … SCHEMA` consumes.
