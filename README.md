## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for integration tests)
- Node.js >= 20 (for TypeScript compilation)

### Setup

```bash
bun install
```

### Commands

```bash
bun run build           # Build all packages
bun run test            # Test all packages
bun run test:pg-delta   # Test pg-delta only
bun run test:pg-topo    # Test pg-topo only
bun run coverage        # Test coverage report (all packages)
bun run check-types     # Type check all packages
bun run format-and-lint # Format and lint all code
```

### Test coverage

`bun run coverage` runs both packages' suites with Istanbul instrumentation and
writes an HTML/lcov report to `.coverage-artifacts/` (open
`.coverage-artifacts/index.html`). Docker is required (the suites use
testcontainers).

```bash
bun run coverage                               # everything (unit + integration + corpus)
bun run coverage --unit-only                   # skip pg-delta's slow integration + corpus suites
bun run coverage --pg-image postgres:17-alpine # pin the PostgreSQL image for pg-delta
bun run coverage --skip-tests                  # regenerate the report from the last run
```

New code is expected to come with test coverage — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Working with individual packages

```bash
# pg-delta
cd packages/pg-delta
bun run test src/       # Unit tests only
bun run test tests/     # Integration tests only (requires Docker)

# pg-topo
cd packages/pg-topo
bun run test            # All tests (requires Docker)
```

### Releasing

This monorepo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning.

```bash
bunx changeset          # Create a changeset
bun run version         # Apply changesets to update versions
bunx changeset publish  # Publish to npm
```
