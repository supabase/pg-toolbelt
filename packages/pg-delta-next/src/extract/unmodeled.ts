/**
 * Catalog completeness check — the v1 correctness floor (review finding 1).
 *
 * `extract()` only emits facts for the kinds it models. A user-created object
 * in a kind it does NOT model would otherwise be invisible: never a fact,
 * never a delta, never mentioned in the plan or the proof. That is a SILENT
 * miss, and a migration tool that silently drops part of your schema from its
 * view is not trustworthy. (The proof loop reads source and desired through
 * the same extractor, so a blind spot can even let a proof pass vacuously.)
 *
 * This module scans — in the SAME repeatable-read snapshot as the rest of
 * extraction — for present-but-unmodeled USER objects, returning one
 * `unmodeled_kind` warning per kind found. It is provenance-aware: built-in
 * (initdb-pinned) and extension-owned objects are the system's / an
 * extension's internals, NOT user state, so they are excluded — matching the
 * extractor's own `notExtensionMember` anti-join.
 *
 * "Detect, don't model": v1 need not MODEL these kinds (that is demand-driven,
 * post-v1 — add an extractor + rule + corpus scenario when a real schema needs
 * one). v1 must never SILENTLY miss them. Strict-coverage mode (the CLI /
 * frontend seam) escalates these warnings to a hard stop.
