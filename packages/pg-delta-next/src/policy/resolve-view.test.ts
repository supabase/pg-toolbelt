/**
 * resolveView (docs/managed-view-architecture.md move 3): the policy's
 * non-`verb` scope rules are applied as a FACT-LEVEL projection (both sides +
 * proof reextract), so the proof stays honest by construction. First-match-wins
 * is respected, including the safety case where an operation (`verb`) include
 * earlier in the list protects a fact a later scope exclude would remove —
 * over-projecting would silently drop managed objects, so the rule is: only
 * project a fact out when certain ALL its deltas are excluded; otherwise keep
 * it (the existing delta-level filter still applies).
