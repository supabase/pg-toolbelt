/**
 * pg_partman handler (docs/extension-intent.md §3.3, Deliverable A).
 *
 * pg_partman child partitions are real user-schema tables that carry NO
 * `pg_depend` edge to the extension (so the core extractor's `deptype='e'`
 * anti-join keeps them as facts) and cannot be told apart from a user-declared
 * `PARTITION OF` by `relispartition` alone (CLI-1591). The ONLY authoritative
 * signal is `<partman_schema>.part_config`: a table is partman-managed iff its
 * `pg_inherits` parent (transitively) is registered there.
 *
 * `part_config` is not `pg_catalog`, so this lives in the integration layer.
 * Phase A emits a `managedBy` edge from each managed child to the pg_partman
 * extension fact; `excludeManaged` then drops those children from the diff so
 * a declarative sync never `DROP`s them (CLI-1555). Native AND legacy
 * (trigger-based) partitioning both use `pg_inherits`, so the recursive walk
 * covers every level, including `*_default` and premade children.
