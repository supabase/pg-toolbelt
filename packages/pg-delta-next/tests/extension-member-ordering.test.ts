/**
 * Dependency-resolution decision for the provenance flip (4b Stage 3).
 * Docker required (the Supabase image, which ships citext).
 *
 * DECISION: keep the pg_depend resolver's "collapse member references to the
 * extension" behaviour (src/extract/extract.ts, the pg_proc / pg_type / … CASE
 * branches), now that members are also observed as facts (Stage 2).
 *
 * Why not re-point references to the member fact? A user object that depends on
 * an extension member (a table column of an extension type, a default calling
 * an extension function) records a pg_depend edge to the MEMBER. The resolver
 * collapses that to a depends edge on the EXTENSION. Because the member is
 * projected out by default (excludeExtensionMembers), an edge pointing at the
 * member would be PRUNED with it — and the user object would lose its "create
 * the extension first" ordering constraint, a silent regression. The collapsed
 * edge points at the extension (which survives projection), so ordering holds.
 *
 * This test pins that: a user table using an extension type is ordered AFTER the
 * extension and proves clean. (Member-as-fact observation + projection is
 * covered by extension-member-parity and extension-intent-partman.)
