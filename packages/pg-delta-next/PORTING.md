# Old-suite porting ledger (stage 0)

Every file in `packages/pg-delta/tests/integration/` (63) plus the two
tests/ root files is accounted for here: ported into `corpus/`, merged, or
not ported with a reason. Per-case detail for the ported files lives in the
agent sections below (PORTING-agent1..6).

## Not ported — with reasons

| Old file | Reason |
|---|---|
| catalog-model.test.ts | Requires the Supabase image (base schema fixtures); also asserts old extraction internals |
| extension-operations.test.ts | Requires Supabase image (pgvector); stock-extension coverage exists via index-extension-deps scenarios |
| pgmq-declarative-roundtrip.test.ts | Requires Supabase image (pgmq) + old declarative engine + integration DSL (stage 8) |
| supabase-all-extensions-roundtrip.test.ts | Requires Supabase image; policy-layer concern (stage 8) |
| supabase-base-init.test.ts | Requires Supabase image; policy-layer concern (stage 8) |
| supabase-dsl-e2e.test.ts | Requires Supabase image + filter/serialize DSL (stage 8) |
| dbdev-roundtrip.test.ts | Requires Supabase image + dbdev migrations + integration DSL (stage 8) |
| remote-supabase.test.ts | Manual test requiring a remote DATABASE_URL; skipped in the old suite too |
| security-label-operations.test.ts | Requires the custom dummy_seclabel image; security labels not yet extracted (extend extractor + set PGDELTA_TEST_IMAGE to a dummy_seclabel build) |
| security-label-filter.test.ts | Same dummy_seclabel requirement, plus filter DSL (stage 8) |
| apply-plan.test.ts | Asserts old plan/fingerprint API mechanics; the new plan artifact has its own contract (fingerprints are rollup hashes; covered by unit + proof tests) |
| catalog-export-filter.test.ts | Asserts old catalog-snapshot filtering — policy layer (stage 8) |
| filter-wildcard.test.ts | Filter DSL mechanics — policy layer (stage 8) |
| declarative-apply.test.ts | Old round-apply engine mechanics; the declarative workflow is covered by tests/load-sql-files.test.ts (shadow loader e2e) |
| declarative-schema-export.test.ts | Declarative file export — stage 9 (`exportSqlFiles`) is not built yet |
| rename-roundtrip.test.ts | Rename detection is stage 9 (hash-based candidates); the old test exercised drop+create convergence, which corpus scenarios already cover |
| ssl-operations.test.ts | TLS connection-layer infrastructure; no schema-state representation (per agent 6) |
| example-usage.test.ts | Skipped demo of old test wrappers |
| postgres-alpine.test.ts | Old CI image-build infrastructure test |

# PORTING-agent1.md

Ported from six source files in `packages/pg-delta/tests/integration/`.

---

## table-operations.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| simple table with columns | not-ported — trivially covered by existing `corpus/table-create/`; schema state is a plain CREATE TABLE |
| table with constraints | not-ported — near-identical to "simple table with columns"; no distinct PostgreSQL semantic; covered by table-create |
| multiple tables | not-ported — multiple plain tables in same schema; no distinct semantic beyond table-create |
| table with various types | not-ported — column type variety has no cross-state diff; create-only scenario identical in structure to table-create |
| table in public schema | not-ported — trivially covered by existing `corpus/table-create/` which already targets public schema |
| empty table | ported → `corpus/table-ops--empty-table/` |
| tables in multiple schemas | ported → `corpus/table-ops--multi-schema/` |
| partitioned table RANGE | ported → `corpus/table-ops--partition-range/` |
| attach partition | ported → `corpus/table-ops--attach-partition/` |
| detach partition | ported → `corpus/table-ops--detach-partition/` |
| table comments | ported → `corpus/table-ops--comments/` |
| replace table via enum dependency does not emit standalone drop/create for PK-owned index | not-ported — `assertSqlStatements` checks engine-internal SQL statement shapes (DROP INDEX / CREATE UNIQUE INDEX presence); schema-state scenario (enum change + table replace) is exercised by the roundtrip but the test's value is entirely in the assertion predicate |

**Counts: 12 cases seen / 6 scenarios created / 6 not-ported**

---

## alter-table-operations.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| add column then create unique index on it | not-ported — `sortChangesCallback` tests planner-internal ordering; schema-state (add column + add unique constraint) is already covered by `constraint-ops--pk-unique-check` |
| add column to existing table | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| drop column from existing table | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| change column type | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--column-type-cast/` |
| change column type after dropping dependent view | not-ported — `assertSqlStatements` checks exact count and statement ordering (engine-internal plan mechanics) |
| change column type after dropping dependent view preserves metadata | not-ported — `assertSqlStatements` checks exact count and ordering; also uses `withDbIsolated` for role grant which is cluster-internal metadata, not a cross-state schema diff |
| change column type to enum with default | ported → `corpus/alter-table--column-type-enum-default/` |
| change varchar column type to integer with using cast | ported → `corpus/alter-table--column-type-cast/` |
| set column default | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| drop column default | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| set column not null | ported → `corpus/alter-table--not-null/` |
| drop column not null | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--not-null/` |
| multiple alter operations - state-based diffing | ported → `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| complex column changes | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--multi-alter-ops/` |
| generated column operations | ported → `corpus/alter-table--generated-column/` |
| drop generated column | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--generated-column/` |
| alter generated column expression | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--generated-column/` (sortChangesCallback tests planner ordering; schema state is modelled) |
| table and column comments | not-ported — schema-state identical to `corpus/comments/` which already exercises table/column COMMENT |
| widen column type preserves pre-existing default | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--column-type-cast/` (seed.sql carries the pre-existing default row) |
| change column type from enum to text preserves default | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--column-type-enum-default/` (reverse direction exercised automatically by the harness) |
| set replica identity using index on existing table | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--replica-identity/` |
| create table with replica identity using index | merged-into `corpus/alter-table--replica-identity/` |
| redefine replica identity index without changing the table's replica identity setting | ported → `corpus/alter-table--replica-identity/` (most complex variant; covers the post-diff normalization re-emit) |

**Counts: 23 cases seen / 6 scenarios created / 6 not-ported (rest merged)**

## constraint-operations.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| add primary key constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` |
| add unique constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` |
| add check constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` |
| add CHECK (FALSE) NO INHERIT constraint on inheritance parent | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--no-inherit-check/` |
| add CHECK (FALSE) NO INHERIT on parent with INHERITS child | ported → `corpus/constraint-ops--no-inherit-check/` |
| drop primary key constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` (reverse direction tested automatically) |
| add foreign key constraint | merged-into `corpus/fk-ordering--basic-fk-new-tables/` |
| modify composite foreign key preserves referenced column order | ported → `corpus/constraint-ops--composite-fk/` |
| drop unique constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` (reverse direction) |
| drop check constraint | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` (reverse direction) |
| drop foreign key constraint | not-ported — schema state (FK present vs absent) already covered by `corpus/fk-ordering--basic-fk-new-tables/` in reverse |
| add multiple constraints to same table | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--pk-unique-check/` |
| constraint with special characters in names | ported → `corpus/constraint-ops--quoted-names/` |
| constraint comments | ported → `corpus/constraint-ops--comments/` |
| add exclude constraint | ported → `corpus/constraint-ops--exclude/` |
| extract exclude constraint defined over an expression | merged-into `corpus/constraint-ops--exclude/` |
| convert primary key to temporal primary key (PG18) | not-ported — PG18-only syntax; no minVersion:18 support confirmed in harness |
| add temporal foreign key constraint (PG18) | not-ported — PG18-only syntax |
| convert related PK and FK to temporal together (PG18) | not-ported — PG18-only syntax |

**Counts: 19 cases seen / 6 scenarios created / 6 not-ported (rest merged)**

---

## not-valid-constraint-convergence.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| created NOT VALID check constraint converges without VALIDATE | ported → `corpus/not-valid--create-not-valid/` (assertSqlStatements checks engine behavior, but schema state — absent constraint vs NOT VALID constraint — is a valid corpus scenario) |
| validated -> NOT VALID drift converges without re-validating | merged-into `corpus/not-valid--validate-drift/` (a.sql = validated, b.sql = NOT VALID; reverse of validate-drift) |
| NOT VALID -> validated drift converges via VALIDATE CONSTRAINT (no drop+add) | ported → `corpus/not-valid--validate-drift/` |

**Counts: 3 cases seen / 2 scenarios created / 0 not-ported (1 merged)**

---

## fk-constraint-ordering.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| FK constraint created before referenced table - should fail without stableId fix | ported → `corpus/fk-ordering--basic-fk-new-tables/` |
| complex FK constraint chain with multiple references | ported → `corpus/fk-ordering--multi-fk-chain/` |
| FK constraint with deferred validation | ported → `corpus/fk-ordering--deferred-fk/` |
| self-referencing FK constraint | ported → `corpus/fk-ordering--self-referencing/` |
| FK constraint with ON DELETE/UPDATE actions | ported → `corpus/fk-ordering--on-delete-cascade/` |
| drop referencing table before referenced table | not-ported — `assertSqlStatements` checks ordering of two DROP TABLE statements (engine-internal sort); schema state (both tables absent) is trivially empty and adds no diff coverage |

**Counts: 6 cases seen / 5 scenarios created / 1 not-ported**

---

## check-constraint-ordering.test.ts

| Test case | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|
| CHECK constraint referencing function created later | ported → `corpus/check-ordering--function-and-type-ref/` |
| CHECK constraint referencing custom type created later | merged-into `corpus/check-ordering--function-and-type-ref/` |

**Counts: 2 cases seen / 1 scenario created / 0 not-ported (1 merged)**

| type cascade drop with dependent table | not-ported under cap-6 — drop cascade covered by `mixed-objects--enum-replace-with-dependents` direction |
| type name with special characters | not-ported under cap-6 — quoted-name coverage exists in `constraint-ops--quoted-names` corpus |

| type comments | not-ported under cap-6 — comment coverage exists in `comments/` corpus; uses `sortChangesCallback` (engine-specific arg) |

---

## catalog-diff.test.ts (15 tests → 5 scenarios)

All tests use `diffCatalogs` with `expect.objectContaining` assertions on the change array — these are engine-internal catalog structure checks. However, each test encodes a valid schema-state transition. The 5 most unique schema states not duplicated elsewhere are ported.

| Test | Fate |
|------|------|
| create schema then composite type | not-ported — schema+composite covered by `type-ops--composite-create`; test only asserts catalog shape |

| create view | ported → `corpus/catalog-diff--create-view/` |
| create sequence | ported → `corpus/catalog-diff--create-sequence/` |

## mixed-objects.test.ts (23 tests → 6 scenarios)

| Test | Fate |
|------|------|
| schema and table creation | ported → `corpus/mixed-objects--schema-and-table/` |

## table-function-dependency-ordering.test.ts (2 tests → 2 scenarios)

| Test | Fate |
|------|------|
| verify tables created before functions with RETURNS SETOF | ported → `corpus/table-fn-dep--setof-function/` |
| verify function-based defaults work via refinement | ported → `corpus/table-fn-dep--function-based-default/` |

---

## table-function-circular-dependency.test.ts (4 tests → 3 scenarios)

| Test | Fate |
|------|------|
| simple function creation | ported → `corpus/function-ops--simple-create/` |
| plpgsql function with security definer | not-ported under cap-6 — SECURITY DEFINER is a serialization attribute; simple-create is representative |
| function replacement | ported → `corpus/function-ops--replacement/` |
| begin atomic sql function replacement | not-ported under cap-6 — BEGIN ATOMIC body-replacement is a variation on `function-ops--replacement`; no new schema-state concept |

| function signature: parameter arity change | merged-into `corpus/function-ops--signature-change/` |
| function signature: parameter name change only | merged-into `corpus/function-ops--signature-change/` |

## trigger-operations.test.ts (16 cases → 6 ported)

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| INSTEAD OF triggers on views are diffed and ordered after view creation | ported → `trigger-operations--instead-of-trigger-on-view` |
| simple trigger creation | not-ported — plain before-update trigger; representational coverage covered by `trigger-operations--trigger-with-when-clause` and existing `corpus/trigger/` |
| multi-event trigger | not-ported — INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE trigger; schema-state coverage already representative; no unique must-have property |
| multi-event trigger preserves UPDATE OF column list | ported → `trigger-operations--trigger-update-of-columns` |
| constraint trigger creation | ported → `trigger-operations--constraint-trigger-create` |
| constraint trigger update | not-ported — merged into constraint-trigger-create (drop+recreate with different DEFERRABLE); schema-state captured by create scenario |
| constraint trigger deletion | not-ported — DROP trigger; covered by `trigger-operations--trigger-drop-before-function-drop` (drop trigger + function pair) |
| constraint trigger comment alteration | not-ported — merged into `trigger-operations--trigger-comment` (comment on constraint trigger is identical in state shape to regular trigger comment) |
| conditional trigger with WHEN clause | ported → `trigger-operations--trigger-with-when-clause` |
| trigger dropping | not-ported — plain DROP TRIGGER; covered by `trigger-operations--trigger-drop-before-function-drop` (richer scenario) |
| trigger replacement (modification) | not-ported — function body change + trigger event change; asserting old-engine statement snapshot internals; schema-state captured by other scenarios |
| trigger after function dependency | not-ported — dependency ordering is an engine-internal concern; schema state covered by `trigger-operations--instead-of-trigger-on-view` |
| drop trigger before dropping trigger function | ported → `trigger-operations--trigger-drop-before-function-drop` |
| drop all triggers before dropping shared trigger function | not-ported — merged into `trigger-operations--trigger-drop-before-function-drop` (same schema-state pattern; two-table variant adds no new state shape) |
| trigger semantic equality | not-ported — asserts zero-diff on identical schemas; not a schema-state scenario (no A→B change) |
| trigger comments | ported → `trigger-operations--trigger-comment` |
| hasura event trigger function introspection | not-ported — asserts old-engine internals (statement snapshot, filter DSL, plan mechanics); remainder is commented-out TODO notes, not an active test case |

**Count: 6 ported**

---

## trigger-update-of-column-numbers.test.ts (1 case → 1 ported)

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| same-named columns on tables with different physical attnums must not produce a trigger diff | ported → `trigger-update-of-column-numbers--attnum-regression` |

**Count: 1 ported**

---

## event-trigger-operations.test.ts (6 cases → 5 ported, 1 merged)

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| create event trigger with tag filter | ported → `event-trigger-operations--create-with-tag-filter` |
| alter event trigger enabled state | ported → `event-trigger-operations--disable` |
| alter event trigger owner and comment | ported → `event-trigger-operations--owner-and-comment` (meta.json isolatedCluster — owner differs between A and B) |
| drop event trigger | ported → `event-trigger-operations--drop` (also covers comment-removal: A has trigger+comment, B has neither) |
| event trigger comment removal | merged-into `event-trigger-operations--drop` (A carries the comment; removing comment is implied by the drop; dedicated comment-removal scenario adds no distinct state) |
| event trigger creation depends on function order | ported → `event-trigger-operations--create-with-function` (schema-state: function+event-trigger exist in B, not A; dependency ordering is validated by the engine) |

**Count: 5 ported (1 merged)**

---

## aggregate-operations.test.ts (10 cases → 6 ported, 4 merged/not-ported)

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| aggregate creation | ported → `aggregate-operations--create` |
| aggregate owner change | ported → `aggregate-operations--owner-change` (meta.json isolatedCluster) |
| aggregate drop | ported → `aggregate-operations--drop` |
| aggregate comment creation | ported → `aggregate-operations--comment` |
| aggregate comment removal | not-ported — merged into `aggregate-operations--comment` (reverse direction is exercised automatically; schema-state of "comment removed" is just A having comment and B not, which is the inverse of the ported scenario) |
| aggregate comment creation depends on aggregate create order | not-ported — asserts engine-internal dependency ordering (sortChangesCallback); schema state identical to `aggregate-operations--create` + comment |

| view replacement with dependency changes | ported → `view-operations--replace-with-new-dep` |
| recreates select-star view when base table columns change | ported → `view-operations--recreate-select-star` (must-have: b.sql has extra column so SELECT * expands differently, requiring DROP+CREATE not CREATE OR REPLACE) |
| complex view dependencies with multiple joins | not-ported — analytics multi-join pattern; schema state is a subset of `view-operations--nested-three-levels`; 6-scenario cap reached |
| valid recursive patterns are not flagged as cycles | not-ported — asserts zero false-positive diff on recursive CTE view; not a schema-state A→B change scenario |

| restore materialized view metadata when replacing for column type rewrite | ported → `materialized-view-operations--restore-metadata-on-replace` (meta.json isolatedCluster — GRANT to role differs; covers comment+grant restoration after DROP/CREATE cycle) |
| materialized view with aggregations | not-ported — merged into replace-definition (aggregation in SELECT list already present there); 6-scenario cap reached |
| materialized view with joins | not-ported — simple CREATE with JOIN; schema state covered by `materialized-view-operations--create` |
| materialized view comments | ported → `materialized-view-operations--comment` |
| refresh materialized view does not trigger a diff | not-ported — asserts zero-diff (DML-only REFRESH, no catalog change); not a schema-state A→B scenario |

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| create btree index | ported → `index-operations--btree-and-multicolumn` (merged with multicolumn) |
| create unique index | not-ported — unique btree index; covered by `index-operations--unique-nulls-not-distinct` (a.sql has plain unique index, b.sql has NULLS NOT DISTINCT) |
| create unique index with NULLS NOT DISTINCT | ported → `index-operations--unique-nulls-not-distinct` (must-have, meta.json minVersion:15) |
| toggle unique index to NULLS NOT DISTINCT | merged-into `index-operations--unique-nulls-not-distinct` (same A→B state; a.sql = plain unique, b.sql = NULLS NOT DISTINCT) |

| create partial index | ported → `index-operations--partial` (must-have) |
| create functional index | ported → `index-operations--functional` (must-have: expression index) |
| create multicolumn index | merged-into `index-operations--btree-and-multicolumn` |
| drop index | ported → `index-operations--drop` |
| drop primary key does not emit separate drop index | not-ported — asserts engine-internal planner behaviour (no separate DROP INDEX for PK); schema-state of "constraint dropped" is captured elsewhere; asserting plan mechanics only |
| drop implicit dependent table index | not-ported — asserts plan mechanics (DROP TABLE cascades index); no standalone index-state change |
| index comments | ported → `index-operations--comment` |

**Count: 6 ported**

## index-extension-deps.test.ts (3 cases → 3 ported)

| Source test | Disposition |
|---|---|
| CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm ordered before CREATE INDEX using gin_trgm_ops | ported → `index-extension-deps--basic` (must-have: extension+index ordering) |
| extension index with cross-schema dependency | ported → `index-extension-deps--cross-schema` |
| plan from null source orders extension before index | ported → `index-extension-deps--from-empty` (a.sql is empty comment; exercises the null-source plan path) |

| policy USING expression references another new table (EXISTS) | ported | `policy-dependencies--policy-using-exists-new-table` |
| policy expression references multiple new tables via IN (SELECT) | not-ported | multi-table variant; ordering property covered by the EXISTS scenario; additional tables provide no new structural signal |
| policy USING expression calls a new function | ported | `policy-dependencies--policy-using-calls-new-function` |

| policy depending on a replaced function is dropped and recreated | ported | `policy-dependencies--policy-depending-on-replaced-function` |
| policy depending on a column type rewrite is dropped and recreated | not-ported | column type rewrite with policy is complex ALTER COLUMN TYPE scenario; that infra is covered by alter-table--column-type-cast corpus; the policy interaction adds ordering signal but would duplicate alter-table corpus entries |

## publication-operations.test.ts

10 test cases total.

| # | Test name | Status | Corpus directory |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | create publication with table filters | ported | `publication-operations--create-with-table-filters` |
| 2 | create publication for tables in schema | ported | `publication-operations--create-for-tables-in-schema` |
| 3 | publication dependency ordering | not-ported | Ordering stress verified by the roundtrip harness automatically; sortChangesCallback is old-engine internal hook not present in new corpus runner |
| 4 | drop publication | ported | `publication-operations--drop-publication` |
| 5 | alter publication publish options | ported | `publication-operations--alter-publish-options` |
| 6 | add and drop publication tables | ported | `publication-operations--add-and-drop-tables` |
| 7 | alter publication schema list | not-ported | Variant of create-for-tables-in-schema; merged coverage via add-and-drop-tables and create-for-tables-in-schema |
| 8 | switch publication from all tables to specific list | not-ported | Covered implicitly by drop+create round-trip; no distinct schema state not already in other scenarios |
| 9 | publication owner and comment changes | ported | `publication-operations--owner-and-comment` |
| 10 | drop table from publication before dropping table | not-ported | assertSqlStatements ordering assertion is old-engine plan/snapshot mechanic; schema state (drop pub then drop table) is a variant of drop-publication already covered |

**Ported: 6 / 10**

## subscription-operations.test.ts

6 test cases total.

| # | Test name | Status | Corpus directory |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | create subscription without connecting | ported | `subscription-operations--create` |
| 2 | alter subscription configuration | ported | `subscription-operations--alter-configuration` |
| 3 | drop subscription | ported | `subscription-operations--drop` |
| 4 | subscription comment creation | ported | `subscription-operations--add-comment` |
| 5 | subscription comment removal | ported | `subscription-operations--remove-comment` |
| 6 | subscription comment creation depends on subscription create order | ported | `subscription-operations--comment-dependency-ordering` |

**Ported: 6 / 6**

Notes:
- All subscriptions use `WITH (connect = false, slot_name = NONE, enabled = false)` so no live publisher is needed.
- `alter-configuration` uses `isolatedCluster: true` because it creates a SUPERUSER role (`corpus_sub_owner`).
- The `sortChangesCallback` in test 6 is old-engine internal; the corpus scenario captures the schema state — both subscription and its comment created simultaneously — which exercises the same ordering constraint automatically.
- VERSION-GATED OPTIONS in alter-configuration (streaming='parallel' PG17, password_required PG16, run_as_owner/origin PG17): the b.sql uses only options portable to PG15+ (binary, synchronous_commit, disable_on_error). Version-specific options can be added as separate minVersion scenarios later.

## foreign-data-wrapper-operations.test.ts

22 test cases total. Cap: 6 most representative.

| 7 | create server with type and version | merged-into | merged into `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--create-server-with-options` |
| 8 | create server with options | ported | `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--create-server-with-options` |
| 9 | alter server owner | not-ported | Owner change is a role-difference scenario; covered by the owner-change pattern in other suites; not in top 6 |
| 10 | alter server version | not-ported | Server version field change; similar in kind to alter-fdw-options already ported |
| 11 | alter server options | ported | `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--alter-server-options` |

| 15 | create user mapping with options | ported | `foreign-data-wrapper-operations--create-user-mapping-with-options` |
| 16 | alter user mapping options | not-ported | expectedSqlTerms assertion (secret redaction check) is old-engine mechanic; schema state is covered by fdw-option-secret-redaction corpus entry |

## fdw-option-secret-redaction.test.ts

1 test case total.

| # | Test name | Status | Corpus directory |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | plan SQL, catalog snapshot, and declarative export never leak option secrets | ported | `fdw-option-secret-redaction--multi-layer-fdw-schema` |

Notes:
- The old test's `expect(planSql).not.toContain(secret)` assertions are old-engine plan/snapshot/fingerprint mechanics — not ported.
- The underlying schema fixture (FDW + server + user mapping + foreign table all carrying OPTIONS with secret-named keys) is ported as a schema state scenario. This exercises the new engine's ordering correctness for the full FDW object graph and signals to test authors that redaction coverage is needed.

**Ported: 1 / 1**

## depend-extraction.test.ts

2 test cases total.

| # | Test name | Status | Corpus directory |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | extractCatalog returns depends with object and privilege edges for rich schema | ported | `depend-extraction--rich-schema-with-privileges` |
| 2 | extractCatalog from main and branch both populate depends | ported | `depend-extraction--acl-and-membership-edges` |

Notes:
- Both tests assert on `catalog.depends` data structure fields (`dependent_stable_id`, `referenced_stable_id`) which are internal old-engine extraction mechanics — those assertions are not ported.
- The rich schema fixtures (view→table deps, ACLs, default privileges, role membership, sequence grants) are ported as ordering stress corpus scenarios. They verify the new engine handles these dependency edge types without assertion on internal data structures.
- Both use `isolatedCluster: true` because they create roles.

**Ported: 2 / 2**

## empty-catalog-export.test.ts

3 test cases total.

| # | Test name | Status | Corpus directory |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | single-database export produces CREATE statements for all objects | ported | `empty-catalog-export--app-schema-with-fk` |
| 2 | single-database export does not emit CREATE SCHEMA public | ported | `empty-catalog-export--public-schema-table` |
| 3 | single-database export captures all user-created objects (Pool fallback) | not-ported | Test asserts `createPlan(null, ...)` fingerprint equality between single-DB and two-DB plan modes — this is old-engine `createEmptyCatalog` / Pool fallback mechanics with no analog in the new corpus runner |

Notes:
- Tests 1 and 2 are ported as schema fixtures (a.sql = empty, b.sql = target state). The "no CREATE SCHEMA public" invariant is an implicit expectation for all corpus runners.
- Test 3's `createPlan(null, db.branch)` vs `createPlan(db.main, db.branch)` fingerprint comparison is entirely old-engine internal API; not representable as a corpus scenario.

## default-privileges-dependency-ordering.test.ts

All 4 tests use `sortChangesCallback` to force wrong ordering, then rely on the engine's
topological sorter to fix it. The `sortChangesCallback` is an old-engine-internal hook.
Per porting rules, we skip the sorter-hook mechanics and port the underlying schema states.

## default-privileges-edge-case.test.ts

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| table revoke a privilege that is granted by default | **ported** | `default-privileges-edge-case--table-revoke-after-default` |

## role-option.test.ts

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| plan contains SET ROLE when role option is provided | not-ported | Engine-internal API assertion (`plan.statements[0]` == `SET ROLE`); no schema-state difference to model |
| extraction uses the specified role | **ported** | `role-option--role-owned-table` (isolatedCluster) — schema state: table owned by non-superuser role |

## role-config.test.ts

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|

## role-membership-dedup.test.ts

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| no duplicate GRANT when membership has multiple grantors (PG16+) | **ported** | `role-membership-dedup--multi-grantor` (minVersion:16, isolatedCluster) |
| no diff when both sides have same membership from different grantors (PG16+) | not-ported | Engine-internal dedup assertion (expects null plan after dedup); both-sides-identical state produces no corpus scenario |
| GRANT role TO postgres WITH ADMIN OPTION is skipped for creator-granted membership | not-ported | Engine-internal self-grant skip assertion; the resulting plan behavior (no self-grant emitted) cannot be expressed as a state pair |
| GRANT role TO child_role works when child_role is not the grantor | **ported** | `role-membership-dedup--basic-membership` (isolatedCluster) — normal membership grant |
| role with admin option to non-self member works correctly | **ported** | `role-membership-dedup--admin-option` (isolatedCluster) |

## sensitive-and-env-dependent-handling.test.ts

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| role with LOGIN generates password warning | **ported** | `sensitive-handling--role-with-login` |
| role without LOGIN does not generate password warning | merged-into | No-login role is the baseline state already present as `a.sql` in `sensitive-handling--role-with-login` |
| subscription with password in conninfo is masked | not-ported | Subscription conninfo masking is an engine-internal output assertion; the b.sql would contain real passwords that must not appear in the corpus |
| server with sensitive options are redacted but safe options roundtrip | **ported** | `sensitive-handling--server-with-sensitive-options` |
| user mapping with sensitive options are redacted | **ported** | `sensitive-handling--user-mapping-options` |
| alter role password does not generate ALTER statement | not-ported | Engine-internal filter assertion (password change suppressed); no meaningful schema-state difference to model |
| alter subscription connection with password is ignored | not-ported | Engine-internal conninfo filter; subscription conninfo is environment-dependent |
| subscription: changing conninfo does not generate ALTER | not-ported | Same as above |
| subscription: changing non-conninfo properties still generates ALTER | not-ported | Subscription binary-mode change is valid but depends on the subscription conninfo setup which requires a live replication publisher |
| server: SET option changes for non-sensitive options generate ALTER | **ported** | `sensitive-handling--server-options-alter` |
| server: adding options generates ALTER (ADD not filtered) | merged-into | ADD options is an additive variant of the SET scenario; covered bidirectionally by `sensitive-handling--server-options-alter` |
| user mapping: SET on password suppressed; SET on non-secret options emits ALTER | merged-into | The non-password option change is the same shape as the user-mapping-options scenario; covered bidirectionally |

## ssl-operations.test.ts

All tests in this file verify SSL/TLS connection infrastructure: sslmode parameters,
certificate chain validation, hostname verification, and CA mismatch rejection.
None of these represent schema-state differences between two databases. The a.sql/b.sql
corpus format cannot express connection-layer behavior (sslmode, sslrootcert, certificate
hostnames, CA trust anchors). All cases are not-ported.

| Case | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| should connect with sslmode=require | not-ported | Connection parameter test; no schema-state difference |
| should connect with sslmode=verify-ca using CA certificate file | not-ported | Connection parameter test |
| should connect with sslmode=verify-ca using CA certificate from environment variable | not-ported | Connection parameter + env-var test |
| should fail to connect without SSL when server requires SSL | not-ported | Connection rejection test |
| should detect schema differences over SSL connection | not-ported | SSL transport test; schema diff content is trivial |
| should connect with sslmode=verify-ca when hostname does not match | not-ported | Certificate/hostname test |
| should reject connection with sslmode=require and wrong CA cert | not-ported | CA mismatch rejection test |
| should reject connection with sslmode=verify-full when hostname does not match | not-ported | Hostname verification test |
