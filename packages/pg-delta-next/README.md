# @supabase/pg-delta-next

Clean-room rebuild of pg-delta per [`docs/target-architecture.md`](../../docs/target-architecture.md)
and the stage guides (`docs/stage-00` … `stage-10`). **Working name** —
final naming is a stage-10 product decision. Private until the cutover
parity bar.

## What works today (proven by the test suite)

The full pipeline, end to end, on the covered kinds:

```text
extract (one consistent txn)  →  fact base (content-addressed, Merkle rollups)
        →  generic diff (fact deltas — zero per-kind code)
        →  rule table → atomic actions → ONE dependency graph → deterministic sort
        →  apply (single txn, per-statement attribution)
        →  provePlan (state proof + data-preservation proof on a TEMPLATE clone)
```

plus the **declarative frontend**: `loadSqlFiles` applies files to a shadow
database with fail-safe ordering (bounded rounds), routine-body
re-validation, shared-object leak detection, and parser-free DML rejection
— then the result flows through the same plan/prove path.

- **Corpus proof loop**: every scenario in `corpus/` proven in BOTH
  directions (build and teardown) — state proof = zero drift deltas after
  applying the plan to a clone; data proof = seeded rows survive. The proof
  reports honest per-table **coverage** (`tablesChecked`, `tablesSkipped`,
  and a `contentMode` of `fingerprint` / `count` / `none`) rather than a bare
  boolean: a non-empty table whose schema is unchanged is content-fingerprinted
  (a count-preserving content change is caught); a table whose schema changed
  is count-checked; an empty table is not checked (seed it for teeth). `ok` is
  backed by that coverage — it is not a guarantee beyond what was checked.
- **Fixture-validity layer**: green independently of the engine, so an
  engine failure can never be a broken fixture.
- **Extractor ring**: fixture DDL → asserted facts/payloads/edges,
  deterministic re-extraction, snapshot round-trip, clone fidelity.

## Kind coverage

schema, role (incl. configs), role memberships, default privileges,
extension, table (incl. partitioned/partitions, INHERITS, replica
identity), column, default, constraint (tables + domains), index,
sequence (incl. OWNED BY), view, materialized view, function/procedure,
aggregate, trigger, policy, rewrite rule, event trigger, domain,
enum/composite/range types, collation, publication, subscription,
FDW/server/user-mapping/foreign-table, comments (one global rule),
ACLs (one global rule, REVOKE-first).

The corpus (`corpus/`, ~195 scenarios) is the port of the old pg-delta
integration suite — see `PORTING.md` for the per-case ledger and the
not-ported-with-reason list (Supabase-image, policy-layer/stage-8,
dummy_seclabel, stage-9 renames/export).

## Stage coverage (target-architecture)

All engineering stages are implemented:

- **Stages 0–4** — corpus + EXPECTED_RED ledger, fact core (Merkle
  rollups, snapshots), extractors (one consistent txn, acldefault-
  normalized ACLs), proof harness (state + data preservation), diff.
- **Stage 5** — the rule table, one mixed graph, deterministic sort,
  compaction (column clauses fold into `CREATE TABLE` when no edge
  crosses the merge — cosmetic by contract, proof-stability asserted),
  the vetted lock-class table, the 10k-object benchmark fixture +
  timing harness (`scripts/benchmark.ts`, in CI), the generative engine
  + soak (`tests/generative.test.ts`, scale with `PGDELTA_NEXT_SOAK`).
- **Stage 6** — plan artifact v1 (engineVersion, safetyReport, lossless
  round-trip), segmented executor (three-valued transactionality:
  `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` runs alone, `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`
  forces a commit boundary before its first consumer), per-action
  applied/unapplied/inDoubt failure reporting, the fingerprint gate,
  session preamble as metadata, render-from-fact-base materialization.
- **Stage 7** — shadow-DB SQL loader + snapshot frontend.
- **Stage 8** — policy DSL v2 (typed serializable predicates,
  first-match-wins, extends with cycle detection), delta filtering with
  reported (never silent) filtered deltas, serialize parameters declared
  by the rule table, baseline subtraction, the Supabase policy package.
- **Stage 9** — rename detection over structural rollups
  (`renames: "auto" | "prompt" | "off"`, ambiguity/near-miss verdicts,
  data preservation proven down to column values), declarative export
  with the `load(export(fb)) ≡ fb` gate (+ an "ordered" layout that
  loads in a single pass), drift, finalized public API (subpath
  exports, reviewed name-by-name in `API-REVIEW.md`), CLI v2.

The proof loop now verifies the two safety fields state-proof alone can't
see (§3.7): **rewrite risk** is observed on the clone (a kept table whose
`relfilenode` changed under no `rewriteRisk`-declaring action fails the
proof) and **data preservation** can be sharpened with opt-in `autoSeed`
(synthetic rows in empty kept tables). Per-kind graph policy
(cascade/rebuild/suppression/defacl) lives entirely in the rule table as
`KindRules` flags — the planner body holds no kind-name lists (guardrail 3).

Every addressable thing is a fact at one grain (§3.1): composite-type
attributes (`typeAttribute`) and publication members (`publicationRel` /
`publicationSchema`) are sub-entity facts, so they diff at sub-entity grain
and are rename candidates — a composite attribute renames in place,
data-preserving, instead of forcing a type rebuild. See `COVERAGE.md` for
the full catalog-coverage map and deliberate exclusions (languages, large
objects, …).

Environment-gated leftovers: security labels are fully modeled (extraction
+ rule + rendering, unit-proven) but their end-to-end proof needs an image
with `shared_preload_libraries=dummy_seclabel`; the real-Supabase-image
baseline proof needs a Supabase container (mechanism + generation script
exist — run `scripts/generate-supabase-baseline.ts`). Stage 10 (cutover) is
a product decision gated on the parity bar — the differential harness, soak
quota at scale, and naming are deliberately not unilateral engineering calls.

Known v1 simplifications:

- extension-member objects are filtered at extraction (full provenance
  edges remain stage-8 follow-up work)
- capture is serial on one snapshot connection (parallel
  `pg_export_snapshot()` workers are a measured optimization)
- a surviving dependent of a destroyed fact is force-rebuilt when its kind
  declares `rebuildable` in the rule table (view, matview, index, policy,
  trigger, rule, constraint, default, procedure); a non-rebuildable
  survivor whose dependency stays gone fails the plan loudly

## Guardrails

See `docs/target-architecture.md` §10. The ones most often relevant here:
no SQL parsing in the trusted path; no per-kind code outside the rule
table; a cycle is a rule bug (there is no breaker module, ever); never
assert SQL bytes in tests — assert state, data survival, or action shape.
