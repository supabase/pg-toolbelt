# @supabase/pg-topo

## 1.0.0-alpha.7

### Patch Changes

- 73aafae: Support PostgreSQL range type ordering in pg-topo, including calls to a range's generated constructor functions. Unqualified built-in type names (e.g. `int4`) now resolve to `pg_catalog`, so calls with keyword casts like `1::integer` match functions declared with `int4` parameters.

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- 7c9a23f: Expose a typed `privilege` payload on GRANT / REVOKE / ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES nodes so consumers can read direction, roles, schemas, and privileges from the AST instead of regex-matching `sql`.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5

### Patch Changes

- fdbcb42: Slice statements by UTF-8 byte offsets so SQL containing non-ASCII text is carried verbatim. libpg_query reports `stmt_location`/`stmt_len` in bytes, but statements were sliced with UTF-16 string indices — any non-ASCII content misaligned the slice and silently swapped the authored text for a deparse fallback that renders `COMMENT ON TRIGGER/POLICY/RULE` targets as invalid dotted names (e.g. `COMMENT ON TRIGGER public.t.tr`). `sourceOffset` is now a character offset (it was a byte offset consumed as a character index by downstream line:column rendering), and a deparse fallback that fails to re-parse now surfaces a `PARSE_ERROR` diagnostic instead of returning invalid SQL.

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- ff57cfc: `analyzeAndSort` now returns every successfully parsed statement exactly once. Each input string is parsed atomically, while separate array entries remain independent. The result keeps its maximal acyclic prefix first, then emits residual cycle components and blocked descendants in deterministic condensation-DAG order. `CYCLE_DETECTED` diagnostics and `graph.cycleGroups` are unchanged.

  Consumers that feed `ordered` into a defer-and-retry applier now receive every successfully parsed statement exactly once. For example, `@supabase/pg-delta` declarative apply now reports genuinely unbuildable cycles as stuck instead of falsely reporting success after dropping the cycle statements.

## 1.0.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- c06f081: Support classifying and ordering ALTER PUBLICATION and ALTER SUBSCRIPTION statements.

## 1.0.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- a5a69fc: Track function dependencies in ALTER TABLE expression subcommands.
- cf0df37: Resolve `COMMENT ON RULE` dependencies so comments are ordered after the rule they target. `objectKindFromObjType` now maps `OBJECT_RULE`, and rule comment refs use the same `relation.objectName` identity as triggers and policies. Plain views now also provide their implicit `_RETURN` rewrite rule, so `COMMENT ON RULE "_RETURN" ON <view>` resolves to the view instead of reporting an unresolved dependency.
- 436b3d1: Support ordering CREATE RULE statements with predicate and action dependencies.

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- 2441e1c: feat: add declarative export/apply and catalog-export to pg-delta

## 1.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- 0cefa0a: alpha release @supabase/pg-topo
