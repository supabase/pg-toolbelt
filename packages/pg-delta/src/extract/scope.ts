 *     the create renders a lone `REVOKE ALL` (grantActions);
 *   - grant-option-only change (same privileges, different grantable) → included.

 * both. It omits `_ownerDefault` — a member delta carries only non-default

 * parallel path overlaps with worker setup so it costs one RTT, not one per

 * Throws if any statement fails — including `pg_export_snapshot()` on a standby or
 * behind a restrictive pooler, which leaves the transaction aborted. The caller
 * recovers by rolling back and re-opening WITHOUT the export.
