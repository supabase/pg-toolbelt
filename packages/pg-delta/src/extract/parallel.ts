/**
 * Bounded-parallel extraction: run the extractor families across N connections
 * that all share the coordinator's `pg_export_snapshot()`, so the capture is
 * still ONE consistent moment in database time (see extract.ts's capture model).
 *
 * Why: on a remote database the serial extractor's cost is dominated by
 * serialization, not work — a sequence of catalog round trips, each paying full
 * RTT, then server execution, then result transfer, one after another. Batching
 * the cheap families removes most of the RTT (see extract.ts's
 * CATALOG_BATCH_GROUPS); fanning what remains out over a few connections attacks
 * execution and transfer too. The engine is unusually well shaped for this: every
 * family reads only its own catalog rows, there are no per-family caches or
 * module-level mutable state, and the ONLY cross-family read in the whole
 * extractor is the pg_depend resolver reading `ctx.facts` — which is why that one
 * family is split into a schedulable SQL half and a post-join processing half
 * (see ./dependencies.ts).
 *
 * The contract is EQUIVALENCE, not speed. Two invariants carry it:
 *
 *  - **Slotted merge.** Each scheduled family gets its OWN collector context and
 *    its results are stored at its family INDEX; the merge concatenates slots in
 *    the fixed call order. Completion order therefore cannot reach the output —
 *    facts, edges, diagnostics and the FactBase rootHash are byte-identical to a
 *    serial run. (Fact insertion order is correctness-irrelevant — buildFactBase
 *    keys by encoded id and re-sorts children — but edge order drives the
 *    dangling-edge diagnostic order, and diagnostics are order-sensitive output.)
 *  - **Silent fallback.** Anything that makes snapshot sharing impossible (a
 *    standby, a pooler that rejects `SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT`, a pool that
 *    cannot spare a second client) degrades to the serial path with NO new
 *    diagnostic. `concurrency` is a performance knob; it must never change what a
 *    caller sees, only how long it takes.
