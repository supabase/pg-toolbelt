/**
 * Stage 2: catalog → fact base (target-architecture §3.1–3.2).
 *
 * Doctrine carried from the old extractor corpus:
 * - logical names, never physical attnums
 * - canonical `pg_get_*def()` output as the comparison form
 * - extraction queries return identity PARTS as columns; only the
 *   library-side codec builds identity strings (guardrail 1)
 *
 * Capture model: a single REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY transaction on one
 * connection — consistent by construction. `ExtractOptions.concurrency` opts
 * into fanning the families out over additional connections that all import the
 * coordinator's `pg_export_snapshot()`, which is the same one moment in database
 * time (see ./parallel.ts); serial remains the default and the fallback, and the
 * two produce byte-identical output — serial is literally the 1-stream case of
 * the same plan (`runFamilies` below).
 *
 * Round trips, not statements, are what a remote extraction pays for. The cheap
 * families are therefore packed into a few multi-statement round trips
 * (CATALOG_BATCH_GROUPS) while the measured-expensive ones keep their own, which
 * takes the whole catalog scan from ~38 round trips to ~23 without changing a
 * single query.
 *
 * Kind coverage is the full v1 set — see packages/pg-delta/COVERAGE.md for
 * the authoritative list (schemas, roles + memberships, extensions, tables and
 * their sub-facts, foreign tables + their constraints, domains, types, indexes,
 * sequences, views, materialized views, procedures/aggregates, collations,
 * policies, triggers, event triggers, publications, subscriptions, FDWs,
 * servers, user mappings, comments, ACLs, security labels). Extension-member
 * objects carry `memberOfExtension` provenance edges and are projected out of
 * the managed view by default (managed-view architecture).
 *
 * The per-family query builders live in sibling modules (`./roles.ts`,
 * `./relations.ts`, `./types.ts`, …) and share the scope, SQL fragments, and
 * the mutable extraction context defined in `./scope.ts`. `extractOnClient`
 * below is the orchestrator: it calls each family in a fixed order so the
 * resulting fact / edge / diagnostic ordering is identical regardless of how
 * the builders are grouped into files.

  // extraction. `has_parameter_privilege` never throws, and the WHERE clause

  // `has_parameter_privilege` reflects the ACL, per a postgres-hackers note —
  // so a real `REVOKE SET ON PARAMETER jit FROM PUBLIC` cannot currently
  // reproduce a permission error here. `has_parameter_privilege` IS false by
