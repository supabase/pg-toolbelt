/**
 * supabase/cli#5555: a declarative sync must not drop platform-managed
 * extensions (the reported `DROP EXTENSION pg_graphql`). The supabase policy
 * projects those extensions out of the managed view entirely — so an extension
 * present on the target but absent from the declarative source produces no
 * remove delta and thus no DROP — while leaving user-declarable extensions
 * (pg_trgm, …) fully managed. Before the fix, pg_graphql was kept in the view
 * and would be dropped. Pure policy level — no DB.
