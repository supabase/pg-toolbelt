/**
 * Integration profile (docs/architecture/managed-view-architecture.md;
 * docs/architecture/extension-intent.md §2).
 *
 * The profile is the ONE module that answers "what state is this engine allowed
 * to manage?" — instead of asking every caller to remember the same sequence of
 * helper calls (handler-aware extraction, policy, baseline, capability, proof
 * re-extraction, apply fingerprint reconstruction).
 *
 * It is split into a STATIC declaration (`IntegrationProfile` — handlers +
 * policy, pure data) and a RUNTIME-resolved context (`ResolvedProfile`).
 * `resolveProfile` resolves capability + baseline ONCE against a source pool and
 * bakes policy + capability + baseline into the plan / prove / apply option
 * bundles, so all three reconstruct the SAME managed view — `plan == prove ==
 * apply` holds by construction (shared option identity), not by comment.
