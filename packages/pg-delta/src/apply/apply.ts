/**
 * Execution (target-architecture §3.8, stage 6): sequential, lock-aware,
 * segmented. Actions self-declare transactionality; the executor groups
 * maximal transactional runs, isolates nonTransactional actions, and
 * honors the planner's commitBoundaryAfter segment boundaries.
 * Segmentation changes transaction boundaries only, never order.
 * Before the first DDL, apply probes the target lock table and refuses a
 * segment whose estimated locks exceed the remaining budget.
 *
 * Mid-plan failure semantics are explicit: every action is reported
 * applied / unapplied / inDoubt, and the error identifies whether an action
 * or an executor control statement failed. A failure inside a transaction
 * segment rolls that segment back (its actions report unapplied); earlier
 * segments are committed (applied); a failure AT commit reports the segment
 * inDoubt.
