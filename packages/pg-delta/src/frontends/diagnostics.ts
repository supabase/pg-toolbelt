/**
 * Diagnostic codes that escalate to blocking under `--strict-coverage`: each

 * strict mode refuses rather than silently ship an incomplete migration.
 *   - `unmodeled_kind`: a user object of a kind the engine does not model.
 *   - `unmodeled_drift`: an unmodeled object the DESIRED state has and the
 *     target lacks. Strictly worse than `unmodeled_kind`: no planned statement
 *     can create it (unmodeled kinds produce no facts), so a generated statement
 *     depending on it fails on the target. Strict mode refuses to ship that
 *     artifact until the operator delivers the prerequisite.
 *   - `unresolved_security_label`: a valid SECURITY LABEL on an unsupported
 *     object (language / database / large object / tablespace) — it cannot
 *     resolve to a managed id, so the label would be silently missing.
 *   - `vault_presence`: CREATE/DROP EXTENSION supabase_vault when vault is
 *     in use (or is being dropped). Secret values and keys are not schema
 *     state; strict mode refuses rather than ship a plan that silently
 *     omits them.
 *   - `excluded-by-cascade`: a desired object skipped because a prerequisite
 *     the policy withholds is absent from the target.
