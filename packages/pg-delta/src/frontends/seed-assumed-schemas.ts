/**
 * Phase 2b (#41): derive the SQL that seeds a co-located shadow database with a
 * target's ASSUMED-SCHEMA objects (e.g. `auth.users` under `--profile
 * supabase`), so a user declarative dir that references those platform objects
 * can load into the otherwise-empty shadow.
 *
 * The managed view (`resolveView`) marks reference-only in ONE set: assumed
 * POLICY objects — assumed-schema objects (`auth.users`) and assumed platform
 * publications (`supabase_realtime`, #370: seeded EMPTY so a user file's
 * `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE …` elaborates; membership
 * facts are managed, never seeded) — and extension members (`net.http_get`).
 * We seed only the former:
 *   - extension members can't be `CREATE`d standalone — `CREATE EXTENSION` owns
 *     their lifecycle — and they don't NEED seeding: they are reference-only on
 *     the target (diff) side, and `diff.ts` skips a fact reference-only on EITHER
 *     side, so a shadow that lacks them plans no spurious DROP. A user file that
 *     references a member is served by the user's own `CREATE EXTENSION`.
 *   - assumed-schema EXTENSIONS themselves (a system extension whose install
 *     schema is assumed, e.g. `pg_graphql` in `graphql`) are NOT members, so
 *     they land in the seed as `CREATE EXTENSION` and materialize their members
 *     for free — the same-cluster shadow has the shared libraries.
 *
 * Symmetry: after seed + user load, the shadow is re-extracted through the SAME
 * profile, so the seeded objects come back reference-only and cancel against the
 * target's reference-only copies in `plan()` — nothing leaks into the diff.
 *
 * The seed is a REPLAYABLE SUBSET of the reference-only facts, not all of them.
 * It replays FIRST, into an empty shadow; the MANAGED objects only come into
 * existence afterwards, when the declarative files load. So a reference-only
 * overlay that DEPENDS on managed state (the field case: a policy on an assumed
 * `storage.objects` whose expression calls a user function in a managed `app`
 * schema) simply cannot replay during the seed phase — PostgreSQL fails the
 * whole seed with `schema "app" does not exist`. Such a candidate is OMITTED
 * WHOLE, together with everything that depends on it and everything it
 * structurally contains. Omitting it is safe and symmetric: generic diffing
 * skips a fact that is reference-only on EITHER side, so a shadow that lacks it
 * plans no create and no drop. No SQL is parsed, inspected semantically, or
 * rewritten to make such a fact replayable — the fact is dropped from the seed
 * set or it is replayed verbatim, never anything in between.
 *
 * Baseline is deliberately NOT applied here (Codex #323 finding 3). The seed is
 * the SUPERSET question — "what platform objects must exist for the user SQL to
 * elaborate in the shadow" — whereas the diff is the SUBSET question — "what do
 * we manage". Only the diff subtracts the baseline. A baseline routinely
 * CONTAINS the assumed-schema objects (e.g. `auth.users`), so subtracting it
 * before the reference-only marking would silently empty the seed and a
 * co-located apply of a user dir referencing those objects could not load. The
 * profile's baseline is still accepted in `opts` so callers pass their resolved
 * options uniformly, but it is intentionally ignored for seed derivation.
 *
 * Non-superuser replay (Unit C): real Supabase Cloud hands users a privileged
 * NON-superuser `postgres`, so the seed must CREATE cleanly as a non-superuser.
 * Two fact classes cannot and are SKIPPED WHOLE (the engine never edits SQL text
 * — the fact is omitted, not rewritten):
 *   - `defaultPrivilege` (ADP): `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE <r>` requires
 *     membership in <r>, which the applier lacks; an ADP entry only governs
 *     FUTURE creation by <r> so nothing a user file creates can depend on it.
 *   - a routine whose proconfig SETs a SUSET (superuser-context) GUC (e.g.
 *     `SET log_min_messages TO 'fatal'`): Postgres validates proconfig at CREATE
 *     time, so a non-superuser cannot create it AT ALL (SQLSTATE 42501). Detected
 *     via `susetGucs` ∩ the routine's structured `_configGucs` (from
 *     `pg_proc.proconfig`) — never by parsing the `def`. The one real occurrence
 *     on the Supabase surface is `realtime.list_changes`.
 * A seeded fact is reference-only on both sides, so its absence is symmetric and
 * cancels in the diff. If a user file genuinely references a skipped routine the
 * load fails LOUDLY at file:line with a precise missing-object error — acceptable
 * (user code essentially never calls these internal platform RPCs, and a clear
 * error beats rewritten SQL). `susetGucs` absent ⇒ nothing is skipped for this
 * reason (byte-identical behavior).
 *
 * All omission reasons (managed dependency, suset-GUC routine, ADP, extension
 * member) feed ONE exclusion closure, so a fact that depends on — or is
 * structurally contained by — an omitted fact is omitted too, whatever the
 * original reason was.
