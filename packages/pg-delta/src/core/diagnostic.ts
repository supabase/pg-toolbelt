/** Diagnostic code for an extension-intent object the handler can KEY but
 *  cannot faithfully REPLAY, because the extension's own catalog does not
 *  record everything its constructor needs — today, a PARTITIONED pgmq queue
 *  (`pgmq.meta` stores the `is_partitioned` flag but not the partition /
 *  retention intervals, which live in pg_partman's `part_config`). Skip + warn
 *  is the honest outcome: emitting a fact whose `create()` guesses the missing
 *  arguments would produce a plan that can never converge. Distinct from
 *  {@link INTENT_UNKEYED} (no stable identity at all) and
 *  {@link INTENT_PRIVILEGED} (replayable, but only by a superuser).
 *
 *  Unlike {@link INTENT_UNKEYED}, this is NOT fatal by side — it is fatal by
 *  COLLISION. On its own (either side) the object is simply unmanaged and the
 *  warning is the whole story, so a diff whose desired state merely CONTAINS a
 *  partitioned queue still plans. `plan()` escalates to an error only when the
 *  OPPOSITE side's fact base holds a fact under the SAME key, where acting on
 *  the diff is wrong in both directions:
 *    - unsupported on the DESIRED side, fact in the source → the diff reads as
 *      a removal and plans a bare destructive drop whose proof falsely
 *      CONVERGES (the desired re-extract skips the fact too);
 *    - unsupported on the SOURCE side, fact in the desired → the plan emits a
 *      create that no-ops against the existing registration (pgmq's create is
 *      IF NOT EXISTS) and the proof fails later with a confusing mismatch.
 *  Reconstructing the would-be id for that check requires the KEY, so an
 *  emitter must put `{ ext, intentKind, key }` in the diagnostic's `context`.
 *  A desired-side diagnostic WITHOUT a key cannot be proven collision-free and
 *  stays fatal (conservative); a source-side one without a key stays a
 *  warning. */

 *  recorded with fabricated empty options, so its true state is UNKNOWN on
 *  that side. A warning at extraction time is not enough on its own: if the
 *  OTHER side of a diff can see the mapping, the missing fact reads as an
 *  intentional add/remove and `plan()` would emit a wrong CREATE/DROP USER
 *  MAPPING. `plan()` escalates to fatal exactly when a delta actually touches
