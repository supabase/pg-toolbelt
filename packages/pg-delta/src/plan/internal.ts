  // An action qualifies iff it materializes an EVALUATED_EXPRESSION_KINDS fact

  // `depends` edges plus the EVALUATED_CHILD_DESCENT parent→child pairs — i.e.
  // *applying it can execute a user routine*. Reachability, not a direct edge:
  //   - a matview's evaluated expression is a whole QUERY, so a matview selecting

  //     coercing the default into the domain runs the domain's CHECKs, which are

 * model), which bloats every create. This prettifies that away — mirroring the
 * old engine's `filterPublicBuiltInDefaults` + owner-privilege filtering, but as
 * a late cosmetic pass so the diff/extract semantics are untouched.
 *
 * An `acl` create group is elidable iff its target object is itself created in
 * THIS plan AND the grant reproduces the grantee's EFFECTIVE create-time default
 * (the built-in default, OR what `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` made it — see
 * effectiveDefaultPrivileges):
 *   - grantee is the target's owner — compared to `_ownerDefault` (the version-
 *     correct built-in owner set captured at extract);
 *   - grantee is PUBLIC — compared to the kind's built-in PUBLIC default.
 * In both cases an active ADP that reduced the default (e.g. revoked the PUBLIC
 * EXECUTE) makes the group load-bearing, so it is kept. Anything else (non-
 * default grant, third-party grantee, grant option, an ACL on a pre-existing
 * object) is kept verbatim.
 *
 * Safe + cosmetic via LOCAL checks: it only drops an `acl` group whose effect PG
 * guarantees on create, and the acl fact id is consumed by nothing outside its
 * own REVOKE/GRANT actions, so removing the whole group strands no consumer and
 * the proven end-state is unchanged. NEVER suppresses a REVOKE the desired state
 * needs (a revoked default is simply absent from the fact base — there is no acl
 * create action to elide, and this pass never adds or removes anything else).

 *
 *  1. SCHEMA (always-on, syntactic): `CREATE SCHEMA s` + `ALTER SCHEMA s OWNER
 *     TO r` collapse into `CREATE SCHEMA s AUTHORIZATION r`. AUTHORIZATION is the
 *     canonical single-statement form even for a foreign owner and carries the
 *     IDENTICAL applier-capability requirement as the two-statement form, so the
 *     fold never changes whether apply succeeds — it runs regardless of
 *     capability.
 *  2. EVERY OTHER ownable kind (only when applier-known): drop the owner ALTER
 *     when the desired owner IS the applier (`capability.role`). On a
 *     creates-as-applier object that is a genuine no-op (already applier-owned on
 *     create). A foreign owner keeps its ALTER.
 *
 * Detected STRUCTURALLY (no SQL parsing — guardrail): the owner ALTER has
 * `verb === "alter"`, produces/destroys/releases nothing, consumes exactly the
 * created object id + one role id, the kind has an `ownerAlterPrefix` rule, and
 * the desired graph carries an `owner` edge object → role. `canSetOwner` already
 * fail-fasts at emit time, so every surviving owner ALTER here is one the applier
 * could run; Rule 2's "keep when owner ≠ applier" only fires for the
 * capability-undefined and superuser-applier cases.
 *
 * The fold also re-checks `canSetOwner` locally (when capability is known): both
 * the schema AUTHORIZATION form and the two-statement form carry the same
 * capability requirement, so an applier that cannot set the owner can run
 * NEITHER. Folding such a pair would be harmless against a converging plan (it
 * fails identically either way), but the local check keeps the pass
 * self-contained — correct even if a future caller runs it without the emit-time
 * fail-fast — instead of silently depending on that upstream guard.
