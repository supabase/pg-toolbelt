/**
 * Missing-requirement guard for objects WITHIN an assumed schema. No Docker.
 *
 * A managed object can depend on something that lives in an assumed schema —
 * e.g. a user trigger on `auth.users`, or a column of an extension type in
 * `extensions`. The guard must satisfy those that are genuinely present at
 * apply time WITHOUT exempting a desired-side reference to an assumed-schema
 * object the target does NOT have (PR #307 review #3499413404): the latter must
 * fail at PLAN time rather than at apply against a missing relation.
 *
 * The decisive signal:
 *  - present on the target → kept reference-only in `source` → `source.has` is
 *    true → satisfied (the in-schema exemption never even runs);
 *  - external to the managed view (e.g. an extension member, hard-pruned from
 *    both sides) → not in `desired` → ambient, satisfied;
 *  - PLATFORM-PROVISIONED (owned by an assumed system role — `assumedPresentIds`,
 *    computed by plan() from the raw owner edges) → ambient, satisfied even when
 *    kept in `desired` and absent from `source` (e.g. Supabase's
 *    `supabase_functions.http_request()`, Sentry SUPABASE-API-8CX);
 *  - otherwise a user-owned object in an assumed schema is hard-pruned and
 *    its dependents cascade out of the view (CLI-2300) instead of remaining
 *    as a kept consumer that throws missing-requirement.
