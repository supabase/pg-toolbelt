  // role don't destroy the mapping, so gating them would be pure
  // over-blocking with no correctness benefit (zero-over-block property). A
  // source-side unreadable diagnostic already PROVES the mapping exists, so a
  // source-side DROP SERVER/ROLE is guaranteed to fail at apply regardless
  // (FK-style: Postgres won't let you drop a server/role a mapping still
  // references) — refusing in plan() just surfaces that earlier and louder.
  //
  // KNOWN LIMITATION (deliberately not handled here, tracked as a follow-up):
  // a role RENAME combined with a one-side-hidden mapping. Identity
  // normalization rewrites visible deltas into the desired role name, while
  // the extraction diagnostic still names the physical role, so a renamed role
  // can be invisible to the `unreadableRoles` name-set below. In the realistic
  // direction (the mapping is hidden on the SOURCE
  // side), this still fails safely — apply cannot rename a role a hidden
  // mapping references, for the same FK-style reason as a DROP. The only
  // truly gap is a hidden mapping combined with a rename that requires an
  // atypical desired-side privilege inversion, which is not addressed by a
  // rename-aware translation here.
  //
  // KNOWN LIMITATION #2 (Codex P1, PR #338 comment 3603601149 — documented,
  // NOT gated): a DESIRED-side unreadable mapping whose containing server (or
  // FDW/role) doesn't exist on the SOURCE side at all. The resulting `add`
  // deltas for the container (CREATE FDW / CREATE SERVER / CREATE ROLE) are
  // NOT gated, so plan() proceeds and simply omits the un-creatable CREATE
  // USER MAPPING (the mapping fact itself was never added to the desired
  // FactBase — it was skipped as unreadable). This is deliberate: the gate
  // family above protects PHYSICAL safety (destroying/failing-to-apply
  // something that already exists); this case is a DESIRED-STATE FIDELITY
  // problem instead — the delta belongs to the server/role, but the
  // manageability question belongs to the mapping, so blocking the
  // container's `add` here would be a policy-projection layering violation,
  // not a safety fix. It's silent-but-visible: the extraction-time
  // USER_MAPPING_UNREADABLE diagnostic already prints (and is a candidate for
  // the #340 reporting channel to surface more prominently); nothing here
  // fabricates or corrupts state. The SOURCE-side analogue is vacuous — a

  // exists on source (extraction reached it to emit the diagnostic), so an
  // `add` for it can never occur from that side.

  //    it owns are the USER's, and a custom `--default-owner` must not
  //    reclassify them as platform-provisioned (Codex P1 #2, PR #407).
