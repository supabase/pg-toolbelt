/**
 * Extraction disables JIT for its catalog queries. `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` on the
 * `pg_depend` resolver (src/extract/dependencies.ts) shows an inflated cost
 * estimate that crosses Postgres's default `jit_above_cost`, so the planner
 * JIT-compiles ~467 functions costing ~59% of a warm run — pure per-execution
 * overhead, since catalog queries gain nothing from JIT. Pinned to the
 * extraction transaction, this removes that overhead without touching the
 * pooled connection outside the transaction.
 *
 * On PG >= 15 the statement is a privilege-guarded
 * `SELECT set_config('jit', 'off', true) WHERE has_parameter_privilege(...)`
 * rather than a bare `SET LOCAL jit = off`. PG 14 has neither
 * `has_parameter_privilege` nor parameter ACLs, so the plain
 * `SET LOCAL jit = off` is used there unconditionally.
 *
 * IMPORTANT caveat validated while writing this test (empirically, and
 * confirmed by a postgres-hackers note): `jit`'s GUC context is
 * `PGC_USERSET`, and PostgreSQL's parameter-ACL machinery deliberately does
 * NOT gate `PGC_USERSET` parameters at the actual `SET`/`set_config()` call
 * site — only `has_parameter_privilege()` reflects the ACL; the real `SET`
 * ignores it. So a genuine `REVOKE SET ON PARAMETER jit FROM PUBLIC` can
 * never reproduce a permission-denied error for `jit` on stock PostgreSQL —
 * confirmed against real postgres:17-alpine containers while authoring this
 * file: after the revoke, `SET LOCAL jit = off` still succeeds unconditionally
 * for a bare non-superuser role. The guarded form is still the right,
 * transaction-safe shape to ship (JS `try/catch` alone would NOT help here —
 * once ANY statement inside a transaction errors, Postgres marks the whole
 * transaction aborted regardless of the JS-level catch, so the fix must avoid
 * the error at the SQL level, which `has_parameter_privilege` does by
 * construction: it never throws, it returns false), and it protects against
 * environments that DO enforce a stricter policy on `SET` (a managed
 * provider's custom hook, a future PostgreSQL version, or any parameter whose
 * context is not `PGC_USERSET`). The regression test below therefore
 * SIMULATES the permission-denied condition via query interception instead of
 * a real `REVOKE`, since the latter cannot produce it for this parameter.
