# Catalog coverage & deliberate exclusions

What the extractor models, and where it deliberately stops. The doctrine:
extract everything as facts at fact grain; deliberate gaps are recorded here,
never silently dropped.

## Fully modeled (own fact kind + create/drop/alter rules + corpus proof)

schema, role (+ config), role membership, default privilege, extension,
table (incl. partitioned/partitions, INHERITS, replica identity), column,
default, constraint (table + domain + foreign-table CHECK), index, sequence (+ OWNED BY;
an identity column's backing sequence is part of the column, and its grants are
`acl` satellites of that column), view,
materialized view, function, procedure, aggregate, trigger, policy, rewrite
rule, event trigger, domain, enum / composite / range type, collation,
publication, subscription, FDW, server, user mapping, foreign table.

Global satellite facts (one rule each): comment (any COMMENT-addressable target),
ACL (acldefault-normalized, per grantable object), security label (every
SECURITY-LABEL-addressable *modeled* target — see the security-label scope note
below; an addressable-but-unmodeled label is diagnosed, never silently dropped).

### Scope notes (where a family is partially scoped)

Most families are fully modeled end-to-end. The cases worth calling out — so
"modeled" is never read as "modeled without limits":

| Family | Extracted | Planned / Proven | Scope notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Constraints | table + domain + foreign-table CHECK | yes | foreign tables carry only CHECK (no PK/FK/UNIQUE/EXCLUSION); serialized via `ALTER FOREIGN TABLE` |
| Foreign tables | yes (columns, options, local CHECK) | yes | inherit/partition-of foreign tables out of scope |
| Security labels | yes (`SECURITY LABEL`) | yes | needs a provider; CI uses the `dummy_seclabel` image. See the dedicated scope note below for which targets are supported / diagnosed / out of scope |
| Extension members | observed via `memberOfExtension` edges | kept reference-only (never diff) | sub-entity member families use the extract-time anti-join (see the extension-members section below) |
| Not modeled | — | — | casts, operators (incl. classes/families), text-search, statistics, transforms, user languages, parameter ACLs: **detected + reported** as `unmodeled_kind`, never silently dropped |

Ownership is modeled as an `owner` EDGE (object --owner--> role), not a payload
field: it diffs as an edge link/unlink that the planner renders as `ALTER …
OWNER TO` (per-kind prefix), and an owner role projected out of the managed view
prunes the edge so the object is created applier-owned — no `skipAuthorization`
param. The `CREATE EXTENSION … SCHEMA` clause is likewise derived from catalog
state (schema presence at plan time, plus the extension's `_relocatable`
metadata for the replace-vs-alter decision), not a `skipSchema` param. The only serialize
param is `concurrentIndexes` (an apply-time strategy). See
[`managed-view-architecture.md`](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/blob/main/docs/architecture/managed-view-architecture.md).

## Sub-entity facts (granularity is one, §3.1)

Composite-type attributes and publication members are full facts, not
payload blobs — so they diff at sub-entity grain, are rename candidates,
and can be `pg_depend` edge targets:

- **Composite type attributes** → `typeAttribute` facts (schema, type,
  name; payload type + collation), parented to the `type`. On a fresh type
  they inline into `CREATE TYPE AS (…)` (delta-set); on an existing type
  they are managed incrementally: `ADD` / `DROP` / `RENAME ATTRIBUTE …
  CASCADE` all work even while the type is used by table columns and
  preserve the stored data.
- **Published tables** → `publicationRel` facts (publication, schema,
  table; payload column-list + `WHERE`), parented to the `publication`.
  **Published schemas** → `publicationSchema` facts. On a fresh publication
  they inline into `CREATE PUBLICATION FOR …`; otherwise managed with
  `ALTER PUBLICATION ADD/DROP`. A per-table column-list / `WHERE` change
  replaces that member (`DROP TABLE` + re-`ADD`), with no churn on the rest
  of the publication.

One irreducible PostgreSQL limitation: `ALTER TYPE … ALTER ATTRIBUTE …
TYPE` is rejected while the composite is used by a table column (`CASCADE`
only reaches typed tables, not columns). The `typeAttribute` rule supports
the attribute-type change for unused composites and fails loudly with a
clear remediation message for in-use ones — it does not emit a statement
that would fail at apply.

## Environment-gated (modeled; integration proof needs a non-default image)

- **Security labels** — extraction (`pg_seclabel` / `pg_shseclabel`), the
  `securityLabel` rule, and rendering are implemented and unit-proven
  (`src/plan/security-label.test.ts`). The create / change-in-place / drop
  cycle is proven **end-to-end** (`tests/security-label-proof.test.ts`)
  against a `postgres:<major>-alpine` image with the `dummy_seclabel` test
  module compiled in and preloaded (`tests/dummy-seclabel.Dockerfile`,
  `tests/containers.ts::seclabelCluster`). The `dummy` provider stores labels
  verbatim (clean apply → re-extract roundtrip), validating against its fixed
  vocabulary (unclassified / classified / secret / top secret). The image is
  built on first run; `PGDELTA_SKIP_DUMMY_SECLABEL_BUILD=1` skips the proof in
  sandboxes that cannot reach the Alpine / GitHub CDNs at build time. The main
  corpus stays on stock `postgres:*-alpine` (label catalogs are empty there, so
  it is unaffected); a CI prebuild of the image is a possible follow-up.

  Three tiers of label TARGET (verified on PG17 with the dummy provider —
  `src/extract/security-labels.ts`):
  - **Supported** (extracted, planned, proven per kind in
    `tests/security-label-proof.test.ts`): table, view, materialized view,
    sequence, foreign table, column, schema, type, domain, function, procedure,
    aggregate, role, event trigger, publication, subscription.
  - **Deliberately unsupported but DIAGNOSED**: a valid SECURITY LABEL target
    that the engine does not model — `LANGUAGE`, `LARGE OBJECT`, `DATABASE`,
    `TABLESPACE`. A label on one of these surfaces an `unresolved_security_label`
    warning (escalated to a hard stop by `--strict-coverage`) instead of being
    silently dropped — the failure mode that would otherwise let a proof pass
    vacuously.
  - **Not addressable at all** (so a label can never exist): index, collation,
    foreign data wrapper, foreign server, constraint, trigger, policy, rule.
    PostgreSQL rejects `SECURITY LABEL ON …` for these object types
    ("security labels are not supported for this type of object"), so they
    cannot appear in `pg_seclabel`.

## Not modeled (deliberate) — but DETECTED, never silently missed

These kinds are not modeled, but a user-created object of one of them is no
longer invisible: `extract()` runs a provenance-aware **catalog completeness
check** (`src/extract/unmodeled.ts`) that emits an `unmodeled_kind` diagnostic
naming each kind found, and the CLI's `--strict-coverage` refuses to plan while
any exist. Built-in (OID < `FirstNormalObjectId`) and extension-owned objects
are excluded — only genuine user state is reported. So the exclusions below are
*enforced and visible*, not a silent gap (review finding 1).

**Where the SQL for these kinds lives.** A kind listed here as detect-only has a
home inside a declarative export: the reserved `_custom/` directory, which
`schema export` never writes into, never prunes, and never refuses on. Its files
are loaded into the shadow (so modeled objects depending on an unmodeled
prerequisite still elaborate) and never executed against the target — the
operator delivers them through their own migration channel, optionally recorded
per file with a `-- pgdelta-migration:` comment that `schema lint` checks. See
[`custom-folder.md`](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/blob/main/docs/architecture/custom-folder.md).

- **Languages** (`pg_language`) — the `language` StableId kind is reserved in
  the codec but not extracted; user-defined languages are rare and the
  built-ins (`sql`, `plpgsql`, `c`, `internal`) are not user state. Add a
  `language` extractor + rule when a real need appears.
- **FTS configs/dictionaries/parsers/templates, operators and operator
  classes/families as first-class facts, casts, transforms, statistics
  objects** — out of v1 scope;
  none are modeled, all are detected. Extension-provided variants are filtered
  at extract time (see below).
- **Parameter ACLs** (`pg_parameter_acl`, PG 15+ — backs `GRANT SET ON
  PARAMETER` / `GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON PARAMETER`) — out of v1 scope; not
  modeled, detected. The probe is version-gated (`minVersion: 15` in
  `unmodeled.ts`'s `PROBES`) since the catalog does not exist on PG 14.
- **Large objects** — out of v1 scope; not modeled and (as data state rather
  than schema DDL) not part of the unmodeled-kind schema check.
- **Sequence `last_value`** — runtime state, not desired schema state
  (matches every comparable tool). Never extracted.
- **Extension version** — excluded from the `extension` payload (a managed
  platform pins versions out of band; including it produces phantom diffs).
- **Collation `collversion`** — excluded (host-glibc/ICU dependent).

## Extension members: observed, reference-only by default (4b)

Extension-owned objects are **observed** at extraction as ordinary facts
carrying a `memberOfExtension` edge to their extension — "provenance is data, an
edge fact, not an extraction-time filter" (§3.1) — and then kept
**reference-only** in the managed view that `plan()`/`prove()` diff
(`extensionMemberClosure` / `extensionMemberReferenceOnly` inside
`resolveView`): the member facts survive as addressable reference targets but
never enter the diff, while their satellite customizations still can. So
policy-free behaviour is unchanged (members never diff), while raw `extract()`
can see them with full ownership provenance.

Flipped (member-ROOT families, each observed + tagged, verified by the
`extension-member-parity` pg_depend oracle): schemas, tables, sequences,
views/materialized views, routines (functions + procedures), aggregates,
domains, enum/composite/range types, collations.

A reference INTO a member (a user table column of an extension type, a default
calling an extension function) resolves to the **extension**, not the member
fact — the `pg_depend` resolver collapses it in a single join keyed on the
member's catalog identity. The member is reference-only in the managed view,
so a member-targeted edge could never order the dependent's DDL; the collapsed
edge points at the extension (a first-class fact that does plan), so ordering
holds — pinned by `extension-member-ordering`.

**Still filtered (documented, regression-free):** sub-entity families (columns,
constraints, indexes, triggers, policies, rewrite rules) and rare member-root
kinds (foreign data wrappers, foreign servers, foreign tables, event triggers,
publications) keep their `notExtensionMember` anti-joins. Their members ride out
with the projected parent (sub-entities) or are vanishingly rare (the rest), so
the default projected behaviour is identical either way; they were left to keep
the migration bounded and fully parity-gated.
